       "['The cellular amount of certain key regulatory factors is the result of a highly dynamic and regulated balance between regulation of synthesis and degradation. Using the multiple stress-inhibited proteolysis of the Sigma-S subunit of RNA polymerase in E.coli as a model system, the proposal submitted here focusses on the two major unsolved problems in the field of regulated proteolysis: (i) the molecular details of selective substrate recognition by the proteolytic machinery, and (ii) the signal transduction pathways that connect environmental stress conditions to the rate of proteolysis of a key cellular regulator. Sigma-S is directly targeted by a recognition factor, RssB, whose affinity for a small region within Sigma-S (a2.5) is controlled by phosphorylation. RssB then transfers Sigma-S to the ClpXP protease, where Sigma-S is rapidly and completely degraded. Molecular interactions between proteolytic recognition sites in Sigma-S (and probably in Sigma-70) and various recognizing factors and chaperones (RssB, ClpX, ClpA) will be studied. In addition, the signal transduction pathways that inhibit Sigma-S turnover in response to various stress conditions will be elucidated. These pathways either control RssB phosphorylation and/or the cellular amount of and interaction with competing binding partners for Sigma-S and ClpXP, such as core RNA polymerase or alternative ClpXP substrates, respectively. These studies should provide important novel insights into regulated proteolysis as well as into complex bacterial signal integration networks in general. ',\n",
       " \"Aim and objective is the co-ordinated handling of projects in the field of pathogenesis, diagnostic and immunotherapy of morbus Hodgkin and related diseases. The pathogenic aspect centres on problems associated with the molecular development of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Emphasis is directed towards the molecular genetic analysis of single cells and the comparison to normal developmental and differentiation processes. The molecular staging of Hodkin's lymphoma represents the diagnostic project focus. The aspect of immunotherapy deals with the immunisation with idio-typ, the gene transfer of T-cell receptors, the use of recombinant fusion toxins and the cytokine gene transfer in Hodgkin cells. \",\n",
       " 'CO2 is an environment-friendly solvent that can be used as a substitute for classical solvents (aqueous or organic). However, the design of a new cleaning process using supercritical CO2 may require the addition of surfactants. The aim of these additives is to increase the solvent power of CO2 which is a non-polar molecule and thus a poor solvent for any polar contamination that is generally encountered in industrial facilities, such as metals, metal oxides or organo-metallic compounds. Surfactants studied in this work are fluorinated siloxane polymers and hydrocarbonated copolymers. Whereas fluorinated molecules exhibit a better compatibility with supercritical CO2, purely hydrocarbonated molecules show a perfect compatibility with existing ultimate waste-treatment facilities. The final goal is to establish a reliable methodology for the process design in terms of surfactants properties and CCb-efficiency. The project will be carried out in cooperation with two research groups from France. The first group will perform experimental solubility measurements of surfactants in supercritical CO2 - These data will be modeled in Dortmund. The second group will use the results of the first two groups for the development of an industrial cleaning process. ',\n",

Where u: Ω C Rn Rn is the elastic deformation; W is the elastic energy density whose minima are the natural distortions of the martensitic variants. In this project we will analyze the behavior of such small surface energy function ε.

       " 'The phenotypic characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus small colony variants (SCVs), in particular their ability to persist intracellular persistence, are causally associated with the etiopathogenesis of chronic persistent infections. Groundbreaking evidence for the association of the SCV phenotype with changes in electron transport processes, in particular in the hemin biosynthetic pathway, was found in preliminary work. However, in natural SCVs isolated from clinical specimens, it remains unclear whether regulatory events or genetic defects lead to the expression of this altered phenotype. On the basis of appropriate preliminary investigations, on the one hand findings on reversible and / or irreversible genetic changes in the DNA sequence of the hemin biosynthesis genes should be obtained, on the other hand the hem promoter regions should be analyzed in order to obtain information about the sequence regions which are crucial for the regulation of the promoter , In addition, possible regulatory proteins will be identified and characterized and the effects of the SCV phenotype on the protein profile of S. aureus will be investigated.']"

It should be noted, however, that procurement auctions usually do not take place in isolation. Instead, different platforms and auction mechanisms compete for the actors. In the proposed research project, the choice of the auction mechanism will be analyzed experimentally in a first step. The focus is on buyer-specific and price-based mechanisms. In the former, the client can select the winner himself based on various characteristics of the bidders (e.g., bid and feedback score), in the latter the bidder with the lowest bid wins the bid. In a second step, it will be examined to what extent communication can meaningfully supplement or replace previous reputation mechanisms. Empirical analysis suggests that communication in buyer-specific procurement auctions plays a similar role as feedback scores.',\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is the comparative synchronic and diachronic analysis of clitic doubling of dative and accusative arguments in varieties of Catalan and Spanish. The project aims at contributing to a general theory of clitic doubling within the generative framework. Clitic doubling is understood as a phenomenon where a clitic pronoun co-occurs with a full nominal DP in the same sentence. Since the clitic pronoun and the full DP share one syntactic function, one case and one semantic role, clitics are especially interesting and pose a challenge for any linguistic theory. Over the years, many factors have been discussed and held responsible for the occurrence and distribution of clitic doubling: grammatical factors such as the categorical properties of DPs (pronominal vs. nominal), case (accusative vs. dative), the occurrence vs. non-occurrence of Differential Object Marking), semantic factors such as animacy, and pragmatic factors, such as specificity and definiteness. From this it follows that an explanation of clitic doubling has to refer to several modules of grammar, i.e. clitic doubling should be regarded as an interface phenomenon. We argue that the emergence of clitic doubling in the Romance languages is the result of the grammaticalization path of the clitic (from DP to D° to phi-features) interacting with the parameter responsible for verb-movement, i.e. the possibility of A-bar-movement in front of the verb by which the information structure of the sentence is changed. Furthermore, since clitics are located at the interfaces, we suggest that the spread from dative clitic doubling to accusative clitic doubling in contact varieties is a consequence of a language contact setting. Optional dative clitic doubling, which underlies semantic and pragmatic restrictions, is acquired late in first language acquisition and vulnerable to variation in bilingual, heritage- or L2 speakers. Thus, we propose that in contact varieties speakers have problems to identify when a nominal should be doubled and when not and therefore overgeneralize the pattern and extend it to accusative nominal as well.

The aim of the project is both a systematic review of the Edda reception in diachronic perspective as well as in their historically specific synchronous contexts. The Edda reception finds its expression e.g. in literature, religion, the fine arts, music, everyday culture and science, and can be localized in a complex field of tension, which i.a. of political, ideological and aesthetic discussions, the development of the concept of myth, the anticereception and the examination of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

Three interrelated questions are at the center of the research interest: How do young democracies deal with the challenge of institutionalizing civilian control? How successful are they and how can differences in the form and scope of civilian control be explained? What impact does this have on the quality and consolidation of democracy? These questions are answered from a dual perspective: on the one hand, from the intra-regional perspective, which is the development of civil-military relations in the young democracies of the Third Wave of Democracy in Northeast Asia (South Korea, Taiwan), Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand) and South Asia ( Bangladesh, Pakistan); second, from the interregional perspective, which integrates this question into a theoretical context and links it to the general research on democracy and transformation. The goal is to arrive at a viable model of civilian control in democratic transformation processes. So far no comparative study of this kind has existed in political science transformation and Asia research. Our project therefore promises new theoretical and empirical findings that go far beyond the current state of research.',\n",
       " \"The turmoil of the financial crisis provokes the question whether price processes in modern financial markets evolve independently of real economic processes and rather arise from irrational exuberance. This question emphasizes the importance of theoretical and empirical work that links financial price processes to the real economy. We place our research proposal in this context. In particular, we intend to investigate the role of idiosyncratic income risk in asset pricing. We are not the first to address this issue, but extant studies suffer from substantial weaknesses: The micro-data on consumption used in previous empirical work are notoriously prone to measurement errors, the assumptions about the individual income processes do not match empirical facts observed in individual income data, and the impact of rare but disastrous income changes is neglected. In Constantinides and Duffie's (1996) base model it is only the cross-sectional variance of income changes which has asset pricing implications. We deal with these weaknesses by developing a coherent measure of idiosyncratic income risk, and by generalizing the income process to allow for rare but severe idiosyncratic shocks. Our empirical analyses will be based on data which are less prone to measurement errors. \",\n",

       " 'Throughout history, advanced and emerging economies have been confronted by a multitude of sovereign debt and financial crises. The dramatic surge in public debt in many economies triggered by the recent financial crisis raises the question of the stability and sustainability and leads to concerns about possible adverse consequences for the private sector, particularly for the availability of private credit and thus for investment and economic growth. The objective of this research project is to understand the theoretical mechanisms and quantitative implications of sovereign and private default risks and their interactions on macroeconomic outcomes. To this end, we incorporate debt repudiation in stochastic dynamic general equilibrium models of closed and open economies. The project is organised along three topics. First, we analyse the dynamic properties of fiscal conditionality imposed by international financial institutions on indebted countries in need of financial assistance. We are especially interested in the role of renegotiations on conditionality and how they affect default risks and macroeconomic outcomes. Second, we explore the effects of public debt on the availability of private firm credit and on the capital allocation among heterogeneous firms who are financially constrained and possibly subject to default risk. We study how fiscal deficits are transmitted to the private credit market and to aggregate factor productivity. Third, we consider the relation between sovereign debt and political uncertainty so as to understand how policymakers make strategic use of external debt to manipulate re-election probabilities and how this affects the connection between debt crises and political crises.

We assume that guilt convictions that are out of touch with reality arise from the self-affirmation of social hypotheses in the regular process of hypothesis testing. We also claim that hypotheses about a legal standard deviation (= deviance hypotheses) have a particularly strong self-affirmation tendency. The work program is divided into three parts: First, the o. G. Explanation approach in the context of the occurrence of false allegations for child sexual abuse reviewed, before in a second step, the findings are generalized to other legal and social contexts and other hypotheses. Finally, in the third step, we want to show that guilt convictions lacking in reality entail negative behavioral consequences in the form of suggestive questioning of witnesses and suspected persons.\",\n",
       " 'Legisprudence in crisis bears a twofold meaning: Firstly, the German science of legislation is caught in a crisis itself. After a vital discussion during the 1970s and 1980s, research on legislation has decreased decisively. Secondly, the project seeks to review the science of legislation and to adapt it to current challenges, taking legislation in crisis situations as starting point. The anti terrorism legislation as well as legislation dealing with the financial crisis and nuclear energy shall serve as practical examples of international significance.One part of the research project will focus on the legislative process and its two dimensions: the legislative process as described in the Grundgesetz (German Basic Law) and the unwritten aspects of the decision-making and drafting process. Another part of the project will be dedicated to the creation of provisions, including aspects of temporary legislation and the duty of the legislature to adjust Acts of Parliament. Building on the two preceding parts of the project, a third part will draw the consequences for the concept and function of Acts of Parliament and their role within the whole system of legal acts, as well as for the separation of powers. Due to the significance of European Union law for German legislation, each part of the project will pay particular attention to supranational influences on the one hand, and the handling of the examined issues at the European Union level itself on the other hand. Additionally, further findings shall be drawn from a comparison with the US law.Crisis situations constitute a mirror for legislative developments in general. They can be characterized by their urgency, the reaction to concrete events, the increasing complexity of the legislative object and the resulting insecure factual basis. These characteristics are common for the development of legislation in general. Their examination in the context of crisis situations does therefore allow conclusions for legisprudence in general that will contribute to better legislation capable of coping with current challenges.

However, this connection is controversial. For example, the security aspects of climate change differ centrally with regard to whom they accept as reference objects (who is threatened?), Which logical links (which leads to what?)

Despite the enormous relevance of these findings for the identification of potential premorbid risk factors, the underlying molecular mechanisms of gene-environment interaction effects are largely unexplained. Based on recent animal and human studies, epigenetic changes (DNA methylation patterns) are a promising mechanism in this context and should therefore be systematically investigated within the planned research project.

       " 'A key challenge for the literature in urban economics and economic geography is to provide a consistent theoretical explanation for the empirical observation that, on the one hand, city size distributions in most countries have remained remarkably stable over time, while on the other hand, there has been strong mobility of single cities within the respective urban hierarchy and substantial industry churning and structural change at the national and the local level.Important theoretical approaches, such as the new economic geography pioneered by Krugman (1991 JPE) or the classical urban systems models by Henderson (1974 AER), have explained the spatial structure of an economy from the fundamental trade-off between agglomeration and dispersion forces. This trade-off arises partly within, partly across sectors, and the relative strength of agglomeration and dispersion forces depends on the magnitude of transactions costs for moving goods, people and ideas across space. More recently, a new literature has emphasized the impacts of external trade liberalization and supply- and demand-side induced structural change on the spatial equilibrium structure. The existing theories address the aforementioned empirical trends mostly separately, however, without making explicit their interrelations and interactions.The main aim of this project is to provide significant contributions to our understanding about the processes of regional growth and industrial change. We plan to develop a theoretical framework that combines and extends the two most promising recent approaches, namely Duranton (2007 AER) and Rossi-Hansberg/Wright (2007 RES). Those models are not yet readily suited to explain the empirical trends described above, because (i) they imply highly unrealistic local specialization patterns, (ii) they abstract from industrial change at the national level, and (iii) they assume away trade and mobility costs.In this project we plan to extend and to unify these two models, by allowing for realistic sectoral asymmetries and for various spatial transaction costs, among other things. Our goal is to develop a theoretical framework that allows us to understand how the long-run stability of the city size distribution can be reconciled with strong industrial churning and structural change at the national and the local level. This new theoretical framework shall then be applied to study the impact of spatial transaction costs on these processes in a full-fledged general equilibrium context.In combination with this main goal, we also plan to uncover important insights about the role of economic policy for the processes of regional growth and industrial change. This includes, for example, a detailed analysis of the general equilibrium mechanisms of regional policy and of jurisdictional competition. ',\n",

On the one hand economic agents are heterogenous: they have different tastes, talents and they participate in communities with different objectives and rules.

We are interested in understanding how the personal characteristics and circumstances affect the distribution of well-being between individuals. In this project we concentrate on personal characteristics such as preferences and productivities, and given its preeminent role in social life we focus on the household. More precisely we plan to address two general questions: (i) How does the distribution of talents and preferences between individuals affects the distribution of income and more generally of well-being? This has important consequences for understanding the patterns of the income distributions one witnesses in practice, (ii) To which extent does the fact that individuals live in households affect their well-being and the way it is distributed across all the individuals in the society? Uncovering what happens in the household is of importance for anticipating the impact on the distribution of well-being of alternative redistributive policies. ',\n",

       " 'This contribution to the dialogue between a Christian theology of creation and evolutionary biology charts a new methodological path in its head-on interdisciplinary approach. A docetism in the theology of creation (Pannenberg) poses a major challenge to a realistic theology. It is to be overcome by a considered integration of research in the natural sciences. For this purpose, the project draws constructively on a wider range of results from evolutionary biology. One more recent biological approach arguing for a teleology in evolution (Conway Morris) has not been taken into account by theologians or only in an uncritical way. Construing evolution as blind chance (Gould), however, should also be regarded with skepticism. Moreover, the relationship between organic and cultural evolution with its implications for evolutionary gradualism needs to be discussed, considering both humans by themselves (Tomasello) as well as the continuity between humans and other primates (de Waal: evolution of morality). According to the concept of physically and culturally embedded cognition (Varela, Deacon, Thompson, Tomasello), spirit and matter are not in opposition. Thus the antitheological gene-centered approach to evolution (Dawkins) can be presented with an empirically convincing alternative.These lines of reasoning can be summed up in a concept of creation that highlights the creative activity of the Holy Spirit, thus allowing for co-creative participation by the creature. This way both a rationality of, and contingencies and ambiguities in, evolution can receive their rightful place within the concept of creation.The fact that numerous recent theological publications have been directed against creationism and Intelligent Design is a symptom of crisis. To the detriment of an open society, debates about religion and natural sciences are increasingly sliding into a knee-jerk antagonism between militant atheism and a fundamentalist rejection of evolution. Given this situation it is inadequate to consider the doctrine of creation and the natural sciences as strictly incommensurate entities, one asking for genesis, the other for meaning. The grain of truth in this approach is that merely deducing answers to questions of meaning from empirical findings would be illegitimate reductionism. Accordingly, the point of theology is not merely to take stock of the world in a detached way. However, the influence of cultural factors such as religion and theology on discoveries in the natural sciences is more important than the thesis of incommensurability suggests. Moreover, a docetism in the doctrine of creation that does not explain the confession of God the creator in a way plausible to the natural sciences endangers the status of a realistic theology. Thus, the question posed by Schleiermacher calls for renewed attention: Shall the knot of history be thus loosed: Christianity with barbarism and learning with unbelief? ',\n",
       " 'Essential questions have been addressed by H. Rosenau in his attached expert opinion (page 2). For a summary see my table of contents and 2 overviews (Appendix 7, p. III-XIV. 623-633). What does \"Christian morality\" mean? On the basis of Paul\\'s interpretation, Schleiermacher answers: Freedom from the law, not only from the Mosaic, but from the moral law in general. He dissociates himself from an imperative ethic determined by Kant, Fichte and later by Kierkegaard. Morality is love. By demand, love does not generate. Rather, 1 Corinthians 13: 4-7 describes how she is and what she does. A simple description of how the earthly Jesus behaved can hardly be outdone with commandments. Schleiermacher sees in each action three essential elements and distinguishes - according to the dominant element in each case - 1. the counteracting (purifying) action (eg, church reform, criminal justice), 2. the positively effective (disseminating) action (teaching the faith to non-Christians; a surplus in favor of disadvantaged regions of the world) and 3. performing (not success-oriented) action (to identify oneself as a Christian community, sports if they have a playful character, culture). The three elements complement each other. For example, imprisonment in prison is a performing element - worship. In the death penalty, Schleiermacher sees a disregard for the work of reconciliation of Christ and a proof of political inability. In his political awakening, he blames society for the liberation and education of the then-deprived stratum, which, as he puts it, is in the mechanism of processing the outer nature enslaved class.',\n",

       " 'We seamlessly continue the first phase of the project that had tested postulates of the inhibitory theory of retrieval-induced forgetting with regard to memory for own body movements. Several confirmations of these postulates have resulted. Nevertheless, some of the raised questions had to remain unanswered yet because some of the experimental designs and measurement techniques that we had intended to use require further optimization. Therefore, the second phase of the project uses a newly developed technique categorizing body movements in a different manner than mostly before in order to particularly test to which extent retrieval-induced forgetting of motor sequences is caused by movement-specific inhibition that persist independently of a movement category. In addition, we scrutinize the newly discovered property of modality specificity of retrieval-induced forgetting by contrasting different modalities of memory retrieval with each other. In correspondence with current theoretical developments, we particularly analyze whether a mental context change may be an alternative mechanism underlying retrieval-induced forgetting in lieu of inhibitory processes. Through the use of various designs, several experiments examine different predictions of these competing models that are intensely debated in the current literature. The planned studies do not only promise clarification about to which extent inhibition operates in motor memory in particular but also investigate whether the very young but theoretically more parsimonious context-change account proves successful. The focus on cognitive processes related to mental context changes then also builds a bridge to the second part of the work program that is centered around effects of directed forgetting. Again continuing groundwork from the first phase of the project, we analyze the cognitive processes that contribute to directed forgetting. There is a very similar ongoing debate about inhibition or mental context changes causing effects of directed forgetting. Contrasting alternative theoretical predictions here also aims at putting into practice an examination of the respective postulates in novel manners, enabled only by the use of body movements as experimental material. Moreover, directed forgetting has been investigated only scarcely in motor memory so far. Therefore, novel insights specifically about the organization, as well as processes of storage and retrieval in motor memory can be expected, primarily, however, about whether inhibitory mechanisms influence the accessibility of motoric memory representations.

Three characteristic structural elements of these monastic buildings \"between the church and the world\" are already apparent: The monastery complex seems to be conspicuously usually grouped around two crypts; the \"double cloister\" reflects the well-known use of their convent rooms by the laity and the city public, who had to avoid the brothers. Also peculiar is the frequent, demonstrative integration of a cloister wing in the aisle of the monastery church. In the end, it remained unnoticed that a chapter house in the German region belonged to the monasteries\\' spatial program at most in the early days. The first-time, detailed analysis of structural dispositions and developments will clarify their use by Order members and urban populations. More than other orders, the Franciscan monastery not only served the spiritual and practical organization of the monastic life, but also had to fulfill the expectations and needs of the laity.',\n",

       " 'Understanding environmental change and the behaviour of humans in relation to this change poses important challenges for both natural and social sciences. A major challenge is to understand the cognitive biases that limit the recognition and prevention of environmental degradation. History suggests that without experiencing direct negative consequences, humans often wait for disasters to occur before undertaking measures for adapting to the looming threats. Sea level change is, in this respect, a classical example of a problem often perceived as distant and quite moderate. Research in experimental economics has identified a number of cognitive biases that affect individuals by making their judgments and decisions deviating systematically from what would be rational or reasonable assessments and choices. Yet, very little is known about the biases that influence adaptive behaviour to sea level change, the consequences of such biases, and what can be done to avoid them. Here we propose an integrated experimental economics and modelling project to understand and quantify the relative contribution of main cognitive biases in preventing recognition of and adaptation to sea level change. We will focus our attention on six major biases, which are recognised as the most relevant for environmental change. These are: (1) positive illusion bias, (2) cognitive dissonance, (3) fundamental attribution bias, (4) risk perception bias, (5) in-group bias, and (6) present bias. We will adopt a comparative approach by targeting biases related to sea level rise in two contrasting island groups: Wakatobi Islands (Sumatra, Indonesia) and North Frisian Islands (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany). These two groups of islands are approximately similar in size, both have an important focus on the tourism industry, but are culturally, politically and social-ecologically very different. With an explorative approach, we will first assess and compare the cultural and socioeconomic contexts of the two regions. This will allow us, in a following step, to quantify the relative relevance of the various biases with surveys and behavioural economics experiments. In addition, with Agent-Based Modelling investigations, we will integrate the relevant information gained with surveys and economic experiments into a broader and more flexible simulative context. Numerical experiments will allow us to explore a number of bias distribution hypotheses and their effects in the context of multiple sea level change scenarios. Behavioural biases are a powerful influence on people’s preferences, perceptions and reactions to environmental change. By identifying the variation of these biases and their relative relevance, our project will shed light on the consequences of information processing and adaptation behaviour so that appropriate political, economic and social policies can be designed to mitigate and possibly prevent environmental disasters.

       " \"In recent years, the public discourse about 'integration' has come into increasingly dramatic focus. Many assumptions that lead to migrants experiencing symbolic exclusion and misrecognition are in evidence. Therefore, it is important to analyse the impact of this discourse on migrants' perceptions in order to achieve a better understanding of integration processes and dynamics. The project investigates the conditions and manner in which the discourse on integration influences the dimension of identificatory integration and the best way to specify the unfolding dynamics of this process. The analysis is based on 48 autobiographical narrative interviews with 'people with a migration background' from the former recruitment countries, who are variously positioned in the labour market. These interviews reveal the impact of the recent discourse about 'integration' on the self- understanding, the positioning of the social self and the efforts of migrants towards integration. In particular, the project aims at delineating the crisis emerging out of the experience of misrecognition and reconstructing the coping mechanisms via biographical and normative work that migrants develop in the context of biographical experiences and processes. This research will help to close a gap in knowledge about integration processes and create a bridge between integration research and biographical analysis. \",\n",
       " \"Multi-ethnicity is a European phenomenon that is attracting new attention recently. This study examines the conflict potential of multi-ethnic coexistence using the example of Rigas. Here lived Germans, Latvians, Russians and Jews, who joined a lively cultural exchange especially with the West, but also with the East of Europe. The development of ethnic milieus that developed competing political loyalties and cultural interpretations over a period of a few decades is the central theme of the analysis of a pre-modern, socially articulated society. In the name of increasing politicization and confrontation, were there still levels and spaces of action that united the ethnic groups? Could confession or culture, common good or mere sociability be integrated where ethnicity increasingly polarized? Using the example of Riga's political culture, the differentiated association landscape and an increasingly ethnically segmented cultural practice, it first shows how the multi-ethnic competition was able to mobilize urban society, as well as explains why its contemporaries increasingly marked the boundaries of this self-organization ethnically. Whether multiethnicity necessarily leads to conflicts or whether peaceful forms of multiethnic coexistence can also be observed is finally examined in a European comparison of Riga with Prague and Odessa, which goes beyond the local example and points to the historical causes, problems and opportunities of multi-ethnic societies in Europe.\",\n",

       " 'In his book Method (1932-1948) Eisenstein developed a psycho-aesthetic hypothesis of the effect of art. Art provokes in the recipient during ecstatic perception a jolt to sensuous, prologue thinking that breaks through the rational consciousness. Eisenstein understood this state as a dynamic balance between simultaneous and opposite reactions, as a hypothetical unit of the subconscious, preconscious, and conscious processes of multi-layered consciousness. The structure of a work of art would then be a form adequate to multi-layered consciousness, and the whole variety of forms could be seen as an infinite chain of invariants that can be traced back to a conflict - the basic trauma, which is consciousness in the process of evolution in transition from prologue to logical reasoning. Based on this assumption, Eisenstein was able to develop a universal analysis model with which heterogeneous phenomena can be described, structured and investigated.

Ä., Lev Tolstoy, Balzac, Disney, Griffith, Utamaro, Rublev, from crime novels, Hollywood movies and his own works.',\n",
       " \"From a historiographical perspective, the presentation explores key aspects of the 'change in values' at the transition to a 'postindustrial' society. It focuses on young people as an important carrier group and on the tension between consumption and politics as a central issue. It investigates significant changes in the youthful mass cultures between about 1959 and about 1973, as well as the emergence of subcultures, which in turn significantly influenced the transformation of mass cultures. The main focus is on practices and reflections of social actors, but also discourses on young people are considered. The essay sheds light on how the contours of a youthful mass culture emerged in the 1960s, mixing elements of consumerism with elements of politics in a novel social style. Thus, a first historiographical trail is cut into that thicket that still surrounds the course of the 'change in values' in West German society.\",\n",
       " 'Savagery and violence is omnipresent among young men of all cultures. Conflict regions and failed states are characterized by reoccurring cycles of violence. Instrumental aggression aiming for personal and social power, for dominance, and for acquisition of material resources, has been frequently cited as cause. We suggest that a biological preparedness for hunting behaviour is another essential driving force. Hunting is fascinating and attractive, a desire that makes temporary deprivation from physical needs, pain, sweat, blood, and, ultimately, the willingness to kill tolerable and even appetitive. We postulate that higher regulatory systems, such as frontal lobe based executive functions, prevent the involuntary derailment of hunting behaviour. If this control – such as in child soldiers for example – is not learned, then brutality towards humans remains fascinating and appealing. Blood must flow in order to kill. It is hence an appetitive cue as is the struggling of the victim. Hunting for men, more rarely for women, is fascinating and emotionally arousing with the parallel release of testosterone, serotonin, and endorphins, which can produce feelings of euphoria and alleviate pain. Children learn which conditions legitimate aggressive behaviour and which not. This may explain the fascination with gladiatorial combat, violent computer games but as well ritualized forms like football. ',\n",

It turns out that the same selection of alloys for certain object groups was made in both places far apart from each other. This selection apparently results primarily from the color properties of these alloys. Specifically, the antimony lead bronzes occurring in some groups of objects in both oppida are on the one hand rarely described in the literature and on the other hand refer to the use of primary Fahlerzkupfers, which is even local in the case of Martberg. In Manching, the local processing of almost all alloys detected in the oppidum and the recycling of copper-silver alloys has so far been documented. On the Martberg, brass alloys were used at the latest from LT D 2 and also processed locally, whereby the exact beginning of the processing can not yet be classified in time.',\n",
       " \"The assassination of politically prominent figures has always and in every society been a way to enforce various political interests. Lethal quarrels over the royal throne were a characteristic of monarchies in the Hellenistic period. Lack of mandatory rules of succession such as primogeniture apparently promoted these quarrels. Only affiliation to a dynasty constituted a factor in legitimate succession to the throne. Therefore not only was the monarch himself permanently threatened by the prospect of his closest relatives making attempts on his life, but the king's relatives, as potential competitors for his throne could be in constant fear of elimination by him as well. This raises the question, of which strategies a king who had succeeded to the throne only by killing his own relatives could use to legitimise his own rule. Hellenistic monarchies are usually described by the Weberian ideal type of 'charismatic authority'. But charisma as a basis for legitimate rule first had to be developed. Therefore a further question follows, regarding elites and members of the royal court or, more specifically, about the socially relevant groups, who through interaction with the king accorded charisma to him or refused him their approval, the latter being potentially his death sentence. Another thread to the monarch's and his relatives' life was the rivalry of individual court members competing for the ruler's favour and the best social positions at the royal court. Thus there was a permanent contest for power within the strongly hierarchically structured, monarchically organised Hellenistic court societies. Hellenistic monarchies therefore were highly fragile systems, and assassination was a regular occurrence. This project examines political assassination as an extreme example of physical violence related to the complexity of power and rule in the context of Hellenistic monarchies. With the aid of modern concepts concerning the triad of power - authority - violence (e.g. according to Max Weber and Hannah Arendt) as well as on the basis of the examination on how these three concepts related to each other in ancient political thought, the project will contribute to understanding monarchical structures of domination and royal court societies as well as to the discourses of power/authority and violence in the Hellenistic period. \",\n",
       " 'Inattentional blindness (IB), the failure to notice fully visible unexpected events when attention is otherwise occupied, occurs in a wide variety of contexts and with many different tasks. Despite more than a decade of research on IB, relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying such failures of awareness. The diverse perceptual failures grouped under this single rubric might reflect the operation of a single attention limit or they could reflect the operation of several distinct attention mechanisms. The methods for inducing IB can be grouped into two distinct classes: failures to notice unexpected events that fall outside the spatial focus of attention and failures to notice unexpected events when central resources are limited. The proposed research will isolate and explore these possible mechanisms for IB by testing the impact of individual difference variables that should be associated with just one of these mechanisms. Understanding how different mechanisms contribute to IB is essential for a complete understanding of this sort of failure of awareness, and it also might help to find ways to limit their practical consequences.

The subproject investigates how the law (mainly employment and labour law) is involved in the gendering of collectives and collectivization and (especially) how it constitutes gendered collectivities. The subproject works with the notion that legalized collective action is in crisis. This crisis has evolved in correlation with the changes in workplaces and employment. These changes are characterized by tendencies towards dissolution of establishment boundaries, and blurred boundaries between work and private life, as well as the subjectivization of employment itself. Therefore, the subproject´s inquiry encompasses all forms of collective action in the workplace, this includes new forms which involve virtual and public spaces beyond the establishment itself. Investigations on gender and the law in workplace collectivization will especially have to take into account the extent to which new forms of collective action rely more on self-representation than on legalised forms of representation of interests.

Companies like FriedWald GmbH and RuheForst GmbH, as well as numerous communal providers, offer burials in designated woodland areas. The decision for a burial in a FriedWald Forest is evidently not only motivated by pragmatic reasons.

Which sensations (such as shame and guilt, regret and regret, but also relief and satisfaction) go hand in hand with these experiences? What role do different forms of social inclusion and institutional anchoring play in the emergence or absence of conscience?

They can be used to request information, but also to test knowledge (as in exam questions), to teach (as in Socratic questions), to prompt for a public commitment (as in a debate in parliament), to bring up an issue for extended discussion, or even to make a statement (as in rhetorical questions).This heterogeneous class of uses arises from the interaction of four factors: (i) the denotational content of interrogatives, (ii) the grammatically-determined effect interrogatives have on the context (their 'sentential force'), (iii) properties of the context of use and (iv) Gricean inferences. While the denotational content has long been fruitfully studied in formal semantics, and the last decade has seen great advances in the development of formal models of context and Gricean reasoning, there is as yet no comprehensive formal theory of the sentential force of interrogative sentences. Existing proposals generally focus on the stereo-typical use of interrogatives as requests for information, neglecting many of their other uses.This situation contrasts with the state of the art with respect to the other major sentence types, declaratives and imperatives. For imperatives in particular, recent years have seen a wealth of formally-precise proposals as to what their sentential force is, and how their varied uses arise in context (Schwager, 2006, Portner, 2007, Kaufmann, 2012, Condoravdi & Lauer, 2012).The main objective of the proposed project is to draw on these advances in the study of imperatives to develop a formal characterization of the sentential force of interrogative sentences, embedded in a formal system that jointly models sentential forces and Gricean reasoning, so as to demonstrate how the various uses arise on the basis of the hypothesized dynamic effect.In the course of the project, special attention shall be given to two additional issues. First, rhetorical uses of questions come in two types: those asked with formally unmarked interrogatives and those that contain various kinds of morpho-syntactic devices that force a rhetorical construal. These two types will be compared and contrasted, and fit into the overall theory. Secondly, a particular kind of non-standard interrogative shall be investigated: Infinitival interrogatives like 'where to go?' have a very particular, restricted range of uses as self-addressed, deliberative questions. These shall be investigated by comparing them to their canonical counterparts ('where do/can/should I go?'), which have the normal range of uses, despite sharing a number of curious properties with their infinitival counterparts. \",\n",

The following conditions are considered: (a) the familiarity, and (b) the difficulty of a failure, as well as (c) the flexibility in applying the strategies.In the study, two pairs of car failures are administered in a computer simulation to car mechatronics (n=350) at the end of their apprenticeship. This simulation authentically represent a car mechatronics working environment. Both failures of a pair reflect very similar and well-known symptoms, however, they differ in terms of difficulty (easy vs. difficult). The data is currently being collected within another project. In order to determine the strategies, computer-based data of the subjects behavior is analysed by means of cluster analysis. The data is extracted from logfiles applying theoretical criteria. Success in failure diagnosis is determined using the subjects documentations. To examine the conditions under which the strategies are successful, success rates are determined for each failure and compared. The symptomatic strategies should prove successful in diagnosing the easy failures and unsuccessful in diagnosing the difficult ones. In contrast, the topographic type should prove successful under both conditions. However, only few diagnosticians should use this type with easy failures. Additionally, it is of interest if there are successful diagnosticians who change their strategies within one failure pair: This group should successfully apply symptomatic strategies to the easy failure and they should successfully switch to topographic strategies when diagnosing the difficult one. Presumably, the reason for this change is that the difficult failures refer to well-known symptoms but the causes of the symptoms are unknown. Another aim of the project is to investigate whether success in diagnosing can be predicted by computer-based behavioral data. Furthermore, the relationship between the strategies and some psychological constructs (e.g. failure diagnosis knowledge, intelligence etc.) is examined, and further strategies of failure diagnosis are explored. It is assumed that the project promotes research on subject-specific didactics: If the project theory is confirmed, symptomatic and topographic strategies, as well as the conditions under which they are successful, should be fostered when the aim is to improve car mechatronics performance in failure diagnosis.

The focal points are the London unemployment riots of 1886/87 and the Hamburg dockers’ strike of 1896/97 as well as the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporaries as well as historians repeatedly stressed that these periods can be described as periods of social upheaval as well as times of urban crises. Approaching the examination from a perspective of town history provides the opportunity of a differentiated elaboration of the interplay of competing notions of security. ',\n",
       " 'The resilience of autocracies in various world regions and the emerging model of illiberal capitalist autocracies such as China or Russia has led to a growing scholarly attention on the durability of those regimes. Mainstream literature, however, focuses on the domestic dimension and neglects the international sphere, although autocracies not only seem to resist to the global spread of democracy but also display their own activities of autocracy promotion particularly within their regional realm. Meanwhile, foreign policy has gained relevance as an additional instrument of authoritarian power consolidation but needs a more thorough scholarly consideration in order to capture the dissemination of autocratic institutional elements, policies, rules, values and attitudes.This project argues that the promotion of autocracy (intentional, actor-driven) as well as the diffusion (unintentional, neutral transmission) can be attributed to authoritarian centers of gravity which we define as regimes that constitute a force of attraction and contagion for countries in the near abroad. The question is: What elements are imposed, diffused and transferred, in which way, in which intensity and effectiveness? What mechanisms between the authoritarian gravity centers and the neighboring countries are induced? The project follows three objectives: (1) Addressing the lack of a conceptual basis concerning the international dimension of authoritarian rule and offering a better understanding of the dissemination of autocratic elements through the concept of authoritarian centers of gravity. (2) Identifying the sources, elements, and addressees of autocracy promotion and diffusion and tracing their respective pathways on the basis of a developed analytical, heuristic model. (3) Applying this model in an empirical analysis.The research design is based on a Most Different Cases Design encompassing three identified centers of gravity which represent different regions, different autocratic subtypes and which have in common as the dependent variable the regional framing of autocratic dissemination: Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Kazakhstan. The cross-area comparison addresses the pathways of influence and diffusion towards the neighboring countries. The analysis focuses on the period of time from 2001 until 2014 and will be conducted in a qualitative way.The project provides a conceptual and empirical contribution to the still under-researched field of the international dimension of autocracies and, particularly, findings about the Why, How and What of concrete mechanisms of autocratic dissemination. The spatial category of gravity centers in a regional context implies an added value for explaining the dynamics of autocratization compared to mostly bilateral perspectives. Our study is expected to generate evidence on convergence in the neighborhood of authoritarian gravity centers and thus links to future studies on convergence. ',\n",

       " 'Low-end innovations enable firms to disrupt markets, foster growth and generate profits; they satisfy the need of consumers for new products that are also affordable; and they contribute to providing access to affordable healthcare, housing, and education to help solve Grand Challenges for societies.Previous research on new product development and innovation generated a comprehensive body of knowledge that supports firms in systematically developing and diffusing new products. However, this body of knowledge primarily focuses on high-end innovation. Insights into the systematic management of low-end innovation are much scarcer, which has significant effects on firms and markets.Issues in developing and diffusing low-end innovations arise because managing low-end innovation differs from managing high-end innovation. Previous research points to two interdependent areas that deserve further attention: the individual in the innovation process and the organizational ecosystem for low-end innovation. Analyzing individual decision makers, our previous research has revealed an irrational preference for high-end innovation projects over low-end ones (i.e., a high-end bias). On the organizational level, we found that the organizational ecosystem of firms that successfully commercialize low-end innovations differ substantially with regard to culture, processes and capabilities. Thus, individual-level biases and the organizational ecosystem for innovation require a management approach that minds these low-end idiosyncrasies.Specifically, there is a considerable gap in the research on low-end innovation. While we know increasingly more about how to manage low-end innovation processes, we know virtually nothing about the individuals who are driving low-end innovation in firms; there is no research that describes their profile, motivation, or capabilities. In addition, only limited knowledge exists about the interaction between these individuals and the firm´s innovation ecosystem, and we have no evidence on the effectiveness of low-end innovation ecosystem strategies in firms.Therefore, we specifically focus on low-end innovation, especially low-end innovators in a series of five studies that empirically investigate the characteristics and capabilities of low-end innovators, develop a scientifically valid measurement instrument for low-end innovation preference, analyze the effect of contextual factors, and examine the role of individuals and the effectiveness of strategies that foster an organizational low-end innovation ecosystem.

       " \"Human action control is characterized by its impressive complexity and flexible adjustment in tool use and object manipulation. We aim to investigate the cognitive control mechanisms involved in the evaluation of action affordances associated with an object. It has been reported that some brain damaged patients were especially impaired in using novel, unfamiliar tools while they were less impaired in using familiar tools. Using novel tools requires an evaluation of available action affordances and object functionality. We assume that in patients with impaired use of novel (in contrast to familiar) objects not action perception and action implementation per se are impaired but the cognitive evaluation of an object's functionalitiy. The long-term examination of brain-damaged patients in combination with a sensitive measurement of subjective reports on the functionality of novel tools shall allow us to determine the prevalence of mechanical reasoning deficits and their contribution to overt pathological behaviour in contrast to semantic and procedural knowledge ex-pressed through the familiarity of a tool. Based on behavioural observations in these patients advanced methods of lesion analysis like voxel-based lesion-behaviour mapping and anatomical connectivity analyses (DTI, Diffusion Tensor Imaging) will provide conclusive evidence for associated neural structures. Functional imaging studies comprising multivariate analysis approaches and functional connectivity analyses based on our neuropsychological paradigm in neurological patients shall identify structures in healthy subjects that are specifically dealing with object functionality and object familiarity and elucidate functional interactions within the inferior fronto-parietal action control network. \",\n",

       " \"The Spirit Level theory as developed by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett claims that egalitarian societies have less social problems and enable better lives than inegalitarian societies. The assumed causal mechanism is inequality-induced status anxiety, which leads to behavior by which individuals harm themselves and society at large. The previous project 'Inequality, Status Anxiety, and Quality of Life. An Examination and Extension of the Spirit Level Theory for Europe' examined key claims of this theory. Using data from the European Quality of Life Survey, the project mainly focused on individuals’ general sense of inferiority. The continuation project aims at addressing important research gaps, organized into two modules:Module 1, „recognition and depreciation“. We want to find out, first of all, in which specific situations people feel depreciated. Who feels looked down on, by whom, where and why? We further want to scrutinize positive status experiences, such as recognition. Who feels socially esteeemd, in which concrete situations, and with which consequences for subjective well-being? Our research will be based on a specifically designed survey module, „Recognition and Depreciation in Everyday Life“, which the applicant managed to place in the 2016 SOEP Innovation-Sample. These novel and representative primary data will be available for analysis in autumn 2017.Module 2, „status seeking and the middle class“. While inferiority feeflings are concentrated at the lower rungs of the social ladder (as the previous project has shown), our conjecture is that the status anxiety of the middle class will express itself differently: as status seeking. Since contemporary Western societies are still middle class societies, it is crucial to learn more about this specific type of status anxiety. Regarding key determinants, we expect status seeking to have an ascending social gradient, i.e. to be stronger among the middle class than among the lower class. We further expect status seeking to be higher in the most unequal societies, and lower in the most affluent societies. Regarding consequences, we assume individual status seeking to lower subjective well-being, and collective status seeking to be fertile ground for various social problems characterized by an indistinct or ascending social gradient. We test these assumptions against data for 22-29 countries from the European Social Survey covering the time period 2002-2014. \",\n",
       " 'Evolutionary models have been part and parcel of economics for a long time. A specific class of such models has been developed within game theory. In usual parlance, evolutionary game theory means the combination of evolutionary approaches with non-cooperative games. Particularly close to the theory of evolution in biology are replicator dynamics.So far, only few efforts have been taken to combine evolutionary approaches with cooperative game theory. This is what this projects aims at. We develop and analyze replicator dynamics that are based on cooperative games, particularly with respect to stable populations.In the first part of the project, we study replicator dynamics that are derived from cooperative games with transferable utility (TU games) by help of the Lovász-Shapley solution (Casajus and Wiese, forthcoming, IJGT). Players are regarded as types of agents and their weights as the sizes of the populations of agents of these types. In order to handle them, we have to apply the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side (Filippov, 1988). We establish the relation between the stable populations in these dynamics and the underlying TU games as well as other solution concepts for TU games.The Lovász-Shapley solution is based on a Leontief type technology, i.e., the types are complements. Alternatively, one could consider a technology, where the types are perfect substitutes, or, more generally, technologies that can be described by CES production functions. In the second part of the project, we generalize the Lovász-Shapley solution for these production functions using a construction of Casajus und Wiese (forthcoming, IJGT). We analyze these CES solutions and compare their properties with those of the Lovász-Shapley solution.In the third part of the project, we extend the analysis of the first part to the CES solutions.

       " 'Neglect is a mysterious neuropsychological disorder: difficult to understand and difficult to treat. In this project we want to use the concept of active perception to further our understanding of this disorder and to develop a new treatment approach. Patients with unilateral neglect typically ignore information from their left side. For example when copying a picture of a house they will copy all the details on the right but not those from the left. It is particularly puzzling that neglect patients fail to notice that their pictures and percepts are incomplete. We suggest that predictive coding or the Bayesian account of perception can explain this puzzling observation. Moreover, the Bayesian account also offers an explanation for why prismatic-adaptation therapy improves some symptoms in neglect but not others. To explain this last finding we assume that perception can involve the suppression of incongruent sensory data. We propose to use binocular rivalry to detect signs of suppression and, thereby, to test the predictions derived from the Bayesian account of neglect. The second half of our project aims to exploit one specific aspect of active perception to develop a new treatment for neglect patients. When eye-movements into one direction are prevented, attentional allocation to the corresponding part of visual space is abolished. In neglect, attention is focused onto the right side and the left side is ignored. By preventing eye-movements to the right side we can redress this imbalance and thereby reduce neglect symptoms. We want to develop this approach first in healthy participants, apply it to neglect patients and compare it in its efficacy with a classical treatment approach. ',\n",
       " \"The project aims at an analysis of how German mass media during the Wilhemine era (1890 - 1914/18) enhanced the general public's fascination with new technologies. It will thus revise the common perception among scholars of a largely critical and hostile stance towards technological innovation in Germany during that time. The quantitative approach seeks to ensure a high degree of representativity while previously neglected topics of research in the history of technology come into focus. The project will differentiate two distinct forms of technological enthusiasm, namely the 'technologically sublime' and the individual fascination for speed. It will thus go beyond the simplistic dichotomy of criticism vs. fascination. The guiding question is whether during the 'long turn of the century' a specifically German form of the 'technologically sublime' came into being, especially with respect to airships, civil engineering, and large ocean steamers. Were these technologies symbols of a national identity, and did they display a certain preference for collective instead of individual virtues? Building on contemporary criticism concerning the 'mechanization' of all walks of life and with regard to sociological research dealing with the public acceptance of technology, the project will propose the thesis that during this particular period of modernization fascination rather than functionality has dominated the cultural perception and appropriation of technology. \",\n",
       " 'With the beginning of the war in September 1939, more than half a million people were evacuated to the respective interior of the country on both sides of the German-French border. For those affected, these evacuations, which have hardly been discussed so far by supraregional research, were a key experience of the Second World War. From a European perspective, they were the beginning of a series of compulsory migrations that, like the post-World War I displacement of populations, greatly changed the appearance of the continent until the late 1940s. The research project will analyze evacuations in a broad temporal and international context. On the one hand it asks about the direct political, economic and social implications, i. After the military strategic and official planning in its long-term perspective since the First World War, after the actual course of the evacuations, the often conflict-filled stay of the evacuees in the respective recording areas and their return to the often affected by pillage and destruction homeland. On the other hand, the research project is dedicated to the experiential and memorial historical dimension of the evacuations, which should be made tangible through a combination of written sources with biographical interviews. Characteristic of the project is the explicitly comparative perspective, which in particular asks about the performance of a democratically constituted society like France in comparison with the National Socialist \"national community\" and the effects of evacuations on the relationship between (border) region and nation. By examining transnational and regional interactions in particular, the project contributes to the further development of much-discussed but rarely used approaches to the conflict and occupation situations of the Second World War, such as transfer history, \"Histoire Croisée\" and transnational history.',\n",

       " 'This proposal explores shifting global meanings of forced labour with an approach of sociology of knowledge. We use the International Labour Organization (ILO) as empirical object to analyse these shifts, since it has been concerned with forced labour as an international organization since 1919 and since then it has drastically shaped the discourse on this topic. While during the 1920s forced labour was described by the ILO as a colonial phenomenon, today it is considered as a problem of the world labour market and it is placed in the context of global social inequalities. In the „Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights of Work“ (1998), the ILO declared the elimination of forced labour as a basic right of work. For the first time, the ILO pursues the goal to politically combat forced labour, which stresses a re- orientation. At the same time, the ILO expanded its means of observation to the quantification of forced labour, its statistical categorization, global estimate and measurement through indicators. We ask which continuities and ruptures in the meanings of forced labour can be observed in both configurations.Up to now, this connection has not been addressed by sociological studies. Our specific contribution with this project is to investigate the continuities and ruptures in the meanings of forced labour from a perspective of sociology of knowledge. These are crystallized and objectified in potentially global orders of knowledge. Following new research strands in global historical sociology, we aim at exploring on the basis of two qualitative case studies first the historicity of forced labour as a category in the imperial context and second its current global situation.We assume that the classification and reclassification processes of forced labour between 1919 and 2017 are embedded in different societal configurations. During this period, the category of forced labour has experienced a metamorphosis from a particular extra-European toward a global problem. This shift in the field of reference – following our hypothesis – allows opening the area of employment for forced labour, from which it has been excluded for decades.In order to explore this configuration from a perspective of sociology of knowledge, we suggest an approach based on theories of comparison. This enables us to analyse the classification of forced labour as historical and contingent way of ordering and differentiation between similarity and difference, but also to understand how forced labour can be compared with regard to indicators and measurement.With this proposal we suggest exploring a significant and contested phenomenon within the current world of work, which up to now did not receive recognition as a sociological topic of research, neither in the sociology of work and inequality, nor in the sociology of globalization.

       " \"In recent years, the European economic crisis--and Greece as one major epicenter thereof since 2009--stimulated Greek public debate on identity, and particularly on the relationship between Greek and European identity. Greece's Byzantine past and heritage, as well as today's predominance of an Eastern Orthodox religious affiliation, emerge as aspects of exceptional importance in this debate, which both directly and indirectly affect society, politics, and the actual relationship of Greece with the European Union and its member-states. In this project, I will enquire into the deeper assumptions within the Greek public sphere as these are to be traced in the discourse produced by Greek public intellectuals and academics who share the following two common traits: (a) a claim that Greece possesses a cultural otherness in comparison to the 'West', which (b) is to be traced in its Orthodox Christian and Byzantine roots, from a religious and historical perspective respectively. These intellectual currents will be analysed through the perspective of cultural and religious studies concerning their religious basis and through the perspective of critical geopolitics concerning their implicit understanding of spatiality as demonstrated by the use of concepts such as 'the West', 'our own East' ('e kath' emas Anatole'), the Byzantine 'Oikoumene', and so on. Apart from analysing these ideological currents, the demonstration and analysis of their impact on Greek society and politics is also to be thoroughly studied, i.e. the way these currents partially form public opinion and policy. I expect that through this research project, the deeper roots of Greek public opinion's implicit ambivalence concerning Europe and the European Union will become more articulate, lucid and better understood in their proper dimensions. Not only should this project decisively contribute to the understanding of the Orthodox and Byzantine roots of modern Greek identity per se and of Greece's contemporary ambivalence, but is should also provide the European scholar with an inner perspective on the causes and mechanisms of contemporary Greek political mentality. \",\n",

       " 'Collaborations across species are about to challenge well-established taxonomical and epistemological divides between humans, animals, plants, cultural artifacts and increasingly mediated environments. An anthropocentric position, which has emphasized humankind’s island position and man’s pre-eminence above other livin beings, does not longer work under these new conditions. As a result of the interdisciplinary Human-Animal-Studies, or post- and transhumanist approaches within various fields of theory, plus changing understandings of agency, new concepts of collaboration and communication begin to take shape. Consequently, individual species within the kingdoms of plants, fungi, insects, or microbes as well as technological artifacts are increasingly being reflected upon as actors. With this shifting focus on non-human actors, the presumably obsolete concept of holism reemerges as a fruitful construct. All of the above results in what can be described as the ‚Multispecies Turn’ within contemporary culture. It is located in diverging social fields such as hard and soft sciences, arts, politics, and society. Media studies, as a branch of the humanities with a focus on cultural techniques, can play a crucial role with regard to this Turn, as it often reflects on collaborations which take place with the help of media technologies or within medial environments of various living and non-living actors. Be it dogs as sensors for cancer diagnostics or bacteria’s DNA as data storage – biological actors have already surpassed technological variants in various fields of hard sciences. But what is happening between the species also needs theoretical reflection – a deficit which is also mirrored in the establishment ofnew fields of research such as Animal-Computer-Interaction. While working on exemplary phenomena, the final goal of our research is to close a theoretical and epistemological gap while also addressing the ethical and political implications of these new environments.

By contrast, research into its transformation und suspension by post-conflict peace building is still in its infancy. This is not unproblematic insofar as violence-centered masculinities demonstrably endanger the stability of post-war societies. In addition, they are often associated with an increase in domestic violence. Therefore, the proposed project seeks to address the question of whether and how key instruments of peacebuilding – the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants (DDR), security sector reforms (SSR) and transitional justice measures (TJM) – contribute to the transformation and eventually suspension of violence-centered masculinities. Based on gender research and practice theory, we assume that violence-centered masculinities can be identified and investigated through discursive and social practices at different social levels. Accordingly, we focus on (a) militarized masculinities at the macro level, and (b) military masculinities at the meso level. Specifically, we want to use an exploratory comparative research design to analyze whether and how DDR, SSR and TJM address and change violence-centered masculinities on these two levels in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Uganda while including the internal diversity of the cases into the analysis. We selected these three countries because there is already prima facie evidence (1) that the three instruments of peace-building we are focusing on were deployed, (2) that they contributed to the emergence of stable post-conflict societies, and (3) that violence-centered masculinities have been transformed more or less successfully at different levels. The main objectives of our research project are to contribute to theory development in the field of the transformation of violence-centered masculinities by reconstructing and analyzing selected peacebuilding processes within the comparative framework of multidimensional process studies and to critically inform future peacebuilding efforts.

With regard to the universal principles, concepts and terms which are to be developed examples are by no means interchangeable and random.The project explores the use of examples in the discourse of aesthetics between 1750 and 1850. During this period the philosophical discipline of aesthetics develops and, following Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, systematic essays as well as several scholarly books are written and published. Since the discourse of aesthetics deals with single, conceptually not dissolvable judgements of taste it is an adequate subject of this research project. Focusing on the nature of beauty and its sensual conception, the discourse of aesthetics inherently relies on the use of examples. Whether it is a rose or the statue of a Greek goddess.: In both cases the gain of knowledge through the use of examples has to be reflected on thoroughly since there is a difference between commonly applied examples and newly invented ones. Thus, detailed reflections on examples can be found in crucial parts of the various aesthetics.Therefore, the project aims at investigating the mediation of examples between a claim of general meaning and an objects particular aesthetical moment. Examples are not only used to persuade, but also to memorize knowledge; they are used as agents of insight into complex relations or as striking counter-examples; generally, they are the basis of generating new knowledge. To meet the requirements of this discursive complexity, different dimensions will be analyzed, such as the rhetorical, mnemonic, conceptual, epistemological, and institutional as well as the normative dimension of the use of examples. A broader study of both examples in general and of their use in aesthetics in particular is a desideratum. The project contributes to this research based on extensive material provided by the database Archiv des Beispiels. In this database all relevant examples coming from a broad corpus are systematically collected and organized. Simultaneously, an interdisciplinarily oriented group of researchers will investigate the historical developments as well as the linguistic und discoursive forms of the use of examples in the epistemic field of aesthetics. This approach shall finally give insight into the basic significance of examples and how they work. ',\n",
       " 'This project aims to explore the role of comparison within the ethnographic perceptions of the ancient world. It is assumed that strategies of comparison generally emerge from an interplay of specific dispositions in the observers, a shift in for-eign affairs, and changing public expectations. Accordingly, the main problem is to reveal how strategies of comparison responded to such configurations along with how they influenced ethnographic as well as other academic fields and made a major contribution to understanding a changing world.

       " 'The aim of the research project is to research communicative strategies with which aphasics and their life partners adjust to the consequences of the illness and work on the negative effects on family communication. For this purpose, in a longitudinal study - twelve months after the return of the aphasic to his home environment - video data of family communications are collected and analyzed to see whether both interaction partners together change their communicative behavior in a way that (positive or negative) adaptation to the aphasic disorder to interpret.',\n",
       " 'Despite considerable progress in recent years, our understanding of pathophysiological substrates of depression is still limited. In order to develop more effective interventions it is crucial to learn more aboutcausal and maintaining mechanisms and the ways in which these can be addressed. Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have consistently been found to show increased activity during resting state,decreased task- related deactivation in cortical midline regions and asymmetric activation in lateral prefrontal cortex during emotional and cognitive processing. Furthermore, previous studies reported increased insula activity in MDD patients. These changes might be modulated by glutamatergic neurotransmission and represent a functional correlate of specific emotional and cognitive symptoms of MDD such as negativeaffective bias, negative ruminations, negative self- focus and increased interoceptive awareness. The proposed project aims to investigate neural activity during emotional- cognitive interaction and interoceptive awareness in relation to glutamate concentrations within depression- relevant regions in healthy subjects with increased temperamental vulnerability for MDD, subjects with a current depressive episode and subjects with a chronic course of depression. We aim to demonstrate (a) that increased self- focus and negative affective bias are associated with asymmetric activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and decreased deactivation in cortical midline regions during emotional- cognitive interaction, (b) that interoceptive awareness is associated with increased insula activity, (c) that changes in glutamate concentrations are region- specific and modulate activity during emotional- cognitive interaction and interoceptive awareness, (d) that region- specific increases in glutamate concentration persist in chronic depression and might eventually lead to morphological changes, and (e) that healthy subjects with increased temperamental vulnerabilities show similar changes in functional activity and glutamatergic neurotransmission as patients with a current depressive episode.

       " 'For 2/3 of all dementing persons the domestic setting is the main location for care, treatment and support. These activities and coordinating processes take place by means of communicative actions. Neither everyday problems of reciprocal cooperation and coordination between dementing persons and their relatives, nor the ways in which the interactants deal with them communicatively in their domestic setting have been focused on. This project aims to close this research gap by pursuing the following three questions:1.) How are communicative actions between dementing persons and their relatives practically performed in the domestic setting, with special regard to the reciprocal effects, and why do communicative actions enable a co-orientation between the individuals?2.) Is dementia causing the loss of communication power (Reichertz 2009) of both the relatives and the patients? If so, how can this communication power possibly be reconstructed under the conditions of the dementia from an everyday strategic perspective?3.) Which social figurative patterns (Elias 1997) do emerge from the communicatively obtained adjustment to each other as a basis for everyday strategic cooperation and coordination processes?These three questions shall be answered by (a) participatory observations within the domestic setting, containing treatment and care, (b) by focused videography of selected situations as well as (c) by generating narrative interviews with reference persons of the dementia patients..

       " 'Project C6 explores crossmodal perception, adaptation and learning during human-robot collaboration with the focus on tele-operations, which are performed inside the human operator¿s peripersonal space. In particular, the operator will be able to control a remote robot arm while receiving real-time visual and tactile feedback through an immersive display and haptic input device. The goals are (1) to understand the human¿s perception and action during interactions in the peripersonal space, and (2) to use these insights to allow a human operator to accept the remote robot as an extension of his/her own body, thereby providing the operator effective and efficient interactions with objects near the remote robot arm. The project will use virtual reality and human-computer interaction techniques, and conduct psychophysical as well as fMRI experiments to explore the operator¿s estimations of sizes, distances, and motions in the remote environment.
