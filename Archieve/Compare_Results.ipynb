Our educational competence is based on the experience of teaching students with the subject of mathematics for all types of schools (elementary school, secondary school, high school) and with students of engineering. Wide acclaim has been found in our successful efforts to strengthen the practice orientation of teacher training. In addition, the competence in this field is based on our great successes in the promotion of mathematically gifted and interested students in the \"Berlin network of mathematically-scientifically-profiled schools\". Continuing education is demonstrated through our innovative approach to teacher education. Its increased national impact is confirmed by the project \"Mathematics Anders Machen\" funded by the Deutsche Telekom Foundation. Our course development expertise brings together our extensive experience in the development of teaching materials and learning environments as well as curricula (for schools, but also engineering education). Our expertise has attracted national and, to a certain extent, Europe-wide attention. So we were a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the EU Conference \"The Future of Mathematics Education in Europe\" (Academia Europaea, Lisbon, 2007). Cooperations with ministries of several federal states are based on our competence in questions of curriculum design. Building on our successful activities, we cooperate with a working group that conducts empirical studies on mathematics didactics within the BMBF-funded program \"Neuroscience, Instruction, and Learning\"',\n",
       " 'The aim of this project is to develop efficient numerical methods to control interface evolution governed by Cahn-Hilliard variational inequalities. The applications ränge from quantum dot formation in crystal growth of heteroepitaxial thin films and grain growth to void evolution in microelectronic devices. In all these applications a certain location of phases or special properties of the interface distribution are of importance. The Cahn-Hilliard model is a conserved phase field model based on a diffuse (not sharp) interface. It is usually formulated äs a non-standard variational inequality of fourth Order. The semi-implicit time discretization can be viewed äs a control problem with possibly nonlinear constraints, control box constraints and a highly complex cost function. We wish to study the primal-dual active set strategy and/or a semi-smooth Newton method applied to the optimization formulation to solve the Cahn-Hillard equation. Issues äs preconditioning, adaptivity and efficient time stepping must be approached. The goal is to derive a mesh independent, superlinear convergent method where the dependence on the interfacial thickness is moderate. In practical applications the Cahn-Hilliard variational inequality has to be coupled either to an elliptic System containing an elasticity System and the Laplace equation for the electrical potential or to a nonlinear heat equation. When efficient methods are developed for Cahn-Hilliard variational inequalities these have to be generalised to the extended versions. The final goal is to solve optimal control problems in which the extended versions of the Cahn-Hilliard variational inequality act äs constraints. In addition to the highly nonlinear constraints the cost functional is often non-convex and gradient based. For the first application period we plan to study this optimal control problem analytically. We wish to derive first and second Order optimality conditions äs well äs the existence of Lagrange multipliers. In a possible second application period it is planned to derive an efficient superlinear convergent method for the optimal control problem. Also optimal design problems involving Cahn-Hilliard variational inequalities shall be an issue. ',\n",
       " 'Uncertainty occurs during the development of products and processes, as well as in all phases of the product life cycle. In 2014, for each new car, which was brought to the US market, approximately four already registered cars had to be recalled by the manufacturer. In Germany, three million new cars were registered and 1.5 million cars had to be rectified in the same year. Following the scientists of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 805, uncertainty in the product and potential product defect arises if the corresponding process chains in the three product life cycle phases product development, production and usage cannot be determined to full extend.Thus, the CRC 805 deals with methods and technologies to describe, evaluate and control the propagation of uncertainty in a phased approach. The approach developed by the CRC 805 is based on three pillars. The first pillar consists of the terms, which have been developed and tested by the CRC 805. The methods form the second pillar. The focus is on non-parameterized linkage of uncertainty, robust optimization, robust design and scaling of uncertainty. The third pillar includes the technologies to describe and control uncertainty in production and usage. Here, the research focuses on a process- and usage-integrated identification of uncertainty with sensory components. The third funding period of the CRC 805 focuses on the control of ignorance as a common and important category of uncertainty. Engineering, mathematics and law cooperate interactively to analyze data-induced conflicts as an indication for model uncertainty, model uncertainty as cause of ignorance and resilience as a principle to control uncertainty. Thereby, resilience of systems and process chains is evaluated for deviations of system and process chain characteristics, which exceed the planned tolerance ranges. Since resilience requires the functions monitoring, reacting, learning and anticipating, the question on adaption of process chains and systems as well as the adaption of models and their re-use in the different phases of the product life cycle arises.

       " 'Statistical modeling is the methodology of constructing distribution models from data and additional information about the data-generating mechanism. The goals of such modeling are prognosis, classification, the acquisition of important characteristics of the investigated phenomenon, as well as general explanations of scientific relationships in the discipline from which the data originate. Statistical modeling is becoming increasingly important in the life sciences, engineering and economics, not least because new technologies make it increasingly easy to generate or collect data on highly complex phenomena in large quantities. This results in a growing demand for often complex models as well as the demand for suitable, adaptive modeling processes. In stochastics, statistics, numerics, scientific arithmetic and material disciplines, different \"paradigms\" of modeling have developed. Thus, approaches, foundations and methodologies are meant for finding, validating and interpreting clarifying, formal models for present data for the purposes of data analysis and inference mentioned above. The proposed project pursues the goal of developing these different approaches and a. To fundamentally examine, critically discuss and theoretically and empirically compare likelihood, Bayes, Minimum Description Length approaches and machine learning. The first results obtained in the six-month project period of the applied research semester are to be incorporated in particular in the planning of a new Collaborative Research Center with the title \"Statistics of Dynamic Processes in Economics and Technology\".',\n",
       " 'The research program is rooted in geometry. The research projects cover a wide range of subjects from mathematical physics to number theory, however, the methods used to study these distinct sets of problems are closely related.The most visible unifying technique used in all our projects is cohomology, a versatile tool central to all geometric disciplines, posed to gain yet more importance in years to come. Nearly all of our projects use Hodge theory, Dirac operators, deformation theory, Lie groups or algebraic geometry. This leads to synergism, of which we are taking advantage. The interplay between abstract algebra and concrete geometry is a Leitmotiv of our research.- The participating researchers work in dierent branches of geometry, yet find a common theme in the methods they use. This set-up is ideal for the training of doctoral researchers. They, as well as our postdocs and advisers prot immensely from the interactions between neighboring fields.- Collaboration with our international partners allows our doctoral researchers to immerse themselves into other communities, establish peer networks, and access further expertise.- The group of applicants consists of five tenured professors and four junior scientists. As planned, there has been a change in the second group. This has led to an expansion of our research profile.- The size of our group is big enough so that fruitful regular seminars and working groups can be organized without putting too much strain on individuals. It is small enough so that researchers know each other well.Our research and qualification program exposes our doctoral researchers to a wide range of research problems while conveying the sense of unity that is central to our science.

       " 'Contents Nowadays, modern technologies in life sciences generate high dimensional data where the dimension of the data can be much larger than the sample size. We refer to genome studies in biology and medicine. Within these kind of applications hidden effects (labeled as signals) are typically rarely present. This is called the sparsity in statistics. In connection with genome studies often only a few genome risk positions occur. In order to find these type of effects the statisticians use multiple tests. Their quality is judged by the false discovery rate (FDR). The FDR is the expectation of the rate of the number of false rejected hypotheses divided by the number of all rejections. The most famous test is the Benjamini/Hochberg multiple test published in 1995. In our last DFG-project we studied multiple testing problems, where extended adaptive solutions were proposed. The topic of the present proceeding research proposal is a quality study of multiple tests. It is based on estimation and resampling procedures of the unknown effective FDR. We take into account that the solutions of multiple tests and risk estimation often have a large variance. In practice sparse effects are hidden within a high dimensional noise. We first study various estimators for the effective FDR which are slight modifications of estimators given in the literature. Their variability will be controlled by nonparametric confidence intervals also under sparsity. For this purpose, we will estimate the distribution of the estimators by resampling methods. To this end we propose a modified bootstrap procedure which is related to the so called low resampling bootstrap. Earlier publications of our research group can be used to attack this question. However, due to the sparsity problem given by the signals, new methods must be developed since the ordinary bootstrap of Efron may fail. We like to study the consistency of our estimators for different multiple tests. Then the quality of our resampling procedures is checked. The project will be accompanied by large Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, we like to continue our cooperation with colleagues from molecular biology and biometrical sciences who gave important hints for applications. ',\n",
       " 'Vector optimization is a continuously growing research area with many theoretical and practical applications. Basically, it consists in determining within a set the elements which fulfill a desired optimality property. Usually one has to determine different minimal elements of image sets of feasible sets expressed by means of various constraints through vector functions, and the feasible points where these values are attained. A classical example of a vector optimization problem is the one of jointly minimizing the risk and maximizing the expected return of an investment. There are different notions of optimality for sets, arising from practice or of merely theoretical importance, and most of them are defined by means of partial orderings induced by convex cones. The existing methods and results allow successful theoretical insights in dealing with differentiable, (generalized) convex and even some classes of nonsmooth vector optimization problems. However, the research on algorithms for solving vector optimization problems is significantly less developed than in scalar optimization, although several methods were recently successfully extended from scalar to vector optimization problems.With this project we intend to bring a significant contribution to the development of continuous vector optimization, by dealing with new theoretical and algorithmic challenges in this research field. We will investigate new directions, implement new methods and bring new ideas in this continuously growing research area. Moreover, we will provide improvements and extensions of classical results in vector optimization and, nevertheless, new developments in the algorithmic approaches to solve vector optimization problems. We intend to open new perspectives in dealing with vector optimization problems arising from different fields, especially for those whose objective and/or constraint functions lack differentiability, by treating them via techniques from the fields of convex and, respectively, nonsmooth optimization. We will investigate in five research fields of vector optimization, as follows. The first one concerns vector-minimization notions defined via generalized interiors of the ordering cones, for which we will provide new characterizations and insights. Nonsmooth vector optimization problems are the second theme to be treated. For them we will deliver new optimality conditions formulated via appropriate nonsmooth subdifferentials. The third field consists of generalized convex vector optimization problems, where we will focus on dealing with problems with cone-quasiconvex objective and/or constraint vector functions by extending techniques from cone-convex vector functions. The last two planned directions of research are devoted to algorithms for solving nonsmooth vector optimization problems and their convergence properties, where we will concentrate ourselves on smoothing and splitting type methods, respectively. This project was proposed with the support of professor Radu Bot, University of Vienna. It is conducted in close cooperation with him. ',\n",
       " 'The ability to invade tissue and form metastases (secondary tumours) is what makes cancer so dangerous. Key biological processes occurring during invasion are the secretion of matrix degrading enzymes, cell proliferation, the loss of cell-cell adhesion on one hand and enhanced cell-matrix adhesion on the other hand as well as active migration. A better understanding of the effect that biochemical (intracellular) and cellular processes have on tissue scale rearrangement of cells and matrix may help to develop treatment strategies. Hence, the modelling and numerical simulation of cancer cell invasion is of great interest and is the subject of ongoing research.In this project, we focus on two key aspects in the modelling of cancer invasion: cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (tissue-level modelling) and surface-bound reactions involved in cancer invasion.The modelling will be done on the tissue scale, which allows for an efficient simulation. The model will be analyzed regarding positivity, Turing-type instabilities and the influence of parameters, which are not well-characterized by experiments, on the model output. We will develop a simulation framework to test these models against the original model. Finally, these results will be transferred to a model of lymphangiogenesis in tumors. ',\n",
       " 'Biomedical imaging aims at visualizing structural or functional information necessary for biological and pharmaceutical research or clinical diagnosis. The associated mathematical challenge is to reconstruct the information of interest from measured data, which typically poses an ill-posed inverse problem. Some recent developments focus on multi-modality technologies to enrich image information by fusing multiple imaging modalities. The strategy is to conduct imaging with multiple modalities, for example, performing diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and X-ray computerized tomography (XCT), simultaneously or sequentially. Classical approaches solve the related inverse problems separately and sequentially, such as computing an XCT reconstruction first followed by adding a DOT reconstruction.The natural observation that motivates the current project is that images of the same object, though obtained from different modalities, possess similar complementary feature information. Such feature information is in particular image edges and learned dictionaries for efficient representations. Hence, the complementary feature information from one modality can improve and steer the reconstruction of another modality, and vice versa, in an iterative manner. Our hypothesis is that image reconstructions for multi-modality systems can be jointly performed with enhanced image quality with less measured data via the communication through their feature information.The innovation of this project is to jointly solve the multiple inverse imaging problems rather than sequentially as previous approaches. Specific aims and milestones of this project are: M1) to develop a mathematical theory for feature representations from multiple imaging domains including similarity definitions of features and to apply them in regularization schemes for joint reconstruction from multi-modality data; M2) to establish efficient algorithms and their implementations for multi-modality feature regularized inverse problem; M3) validation of the methods for MALDI plus XCT and for DOT plus XCT. Upon the completion of this project, a new theory for imaging modality fusion will be established together with efficient algorithms and implementations. ',\n",
       " 'In this project we want to analyze finite element methods for parabolic partial differential equations (pPDEs) with main focus on adaptive discretizations.Many processes in natural science and engineering are modeled by pPDEs. Numerical analysis for this problem class is a very active research area at the forefront of numerical mathematics. For many real life problems computations based on uniform methods are by far too time con- suming. The efficient numerical simulation of transient problems necessitates adaptive methods with optimal complexity.Our experience shows that adaptive finite elements for elliptic partial differential equations (ePDEs) have gained substantial maturity. Their use in numerous practical applications reveals a very robust performance. Moreover, proofs of convergence and optimal decay rates in terms of degrees of freedom (DOFs) are available. These proofs are based on a very precise mathematical understanding of the adaptive method as a whole.It is a todays vision to have access to similar robust and efficient adaptive methods for pPDEs. The design of adaptive simulation environments for real life applications would tremendously profit from a better understanding and a better mathematical foundation of adaptive finite elements for pPDEs. However, the analysis of such methods as a whole is yet, from our point of view, in its infancy. We have a single convergence result for the heat equation; a proof of an optimal performance is missing completely.The proposed research project therefore focuses on the design and analysis of rate optimal adaptive finite element methods for pPDEs. This important and challenging topic requires a substantial amount of investigations concerning fundamental properties of appropriate finite element discretizations. We will investigate adaptive approximation classes and decay rates of adaptively generated sequences of discrete solutions. The latter may require new mesh and time-step adaptation schemes.With the proposed research we will substantially foster the development and numerical analy- sis of optimal adaptive methods for pPDEs suitable for real-life applications on high performance computers. In addition, the investigations will contribute to a better understanding needed for the optimality analysis of adaptive methods for strongly non-symmetric problems. ',\n",
       " \"With greatly advanced computational resources, the scope of statistical data analysis and modeling accommodates pressing new arenas of application for modern multivariate inference methods. Analyzing multivariate data usually faces several challenges, partly due to possibly complex dependence structures between the different variables. Additionally, the endpoints are typically not measured on the same scale, hence assumptions of specific covariance structures are inadequate. Particularly difficult is inference for multivariate data in which one or more endpoints are ordinal, as methods assuming multivariate normality are obviously inappropriate for such data. However, also skewed or discrete data are not appropriately described by a multivariate normal model. Moreover, data are usually collected in elaborate factorial settings, and the complexity increases if the number of endpoint is greater than the number of independent experimental units (high-dimensional data). Among the main questions arising in those studies are the detection of endpoints, group levels, or combinations of these, causing statistical significance. In order to be able to answer these questions, it is desirable to have powerful procedures available that do not make restrictive model assumptions. Central themes of this project are the derivation of 1. asymptotically valid tests based on a semiparametric location model without normality assumption 2. rank-based inference methods using a purely nonparametric model framework 3. approximations and adjustments to 1.-2. for small sample sizes or high dimensional observations, based on different bootstrap, randomization, or moment approximation techniques. 4. multiple testing procedures to investigate 'local' questions, after having performed 'global' tests, and in case 2. also 5. extensions of the above methods to censored data and 6. extensions of the above methods to detect specific patterns of alternatives. In the first topic, powerful inference tools for possibly high-dimensional multivariate data are derived, based on expected values, while the second topic considers generalizations of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney type tests to multivariate layouts, using a different hypothesis formulation. In the third topic, approximative inferential solutions are developed, using resampling and other techniques. The fourth topic provides the logical next step away from global decisions to detecting the relevant variables or factor level combinations that are responsible for significant results. The fifth topic addresses issues of data which are observed incompletely due to censoring, which is quite frequent in real data collection. Finally, in the sixth topic, inference methods are devised to be more powerful for the detection of specific a priori specified alternatives, for example increasing or decreasing trends. The results promise to have wide application and to broadly enhance the role of statistical science. \",\n",

In a truly international environment, doctoral students will learn to discover and to exploit structures that help to understand singular and random systems.Mankind has been fascinated by regular structures for a very long time. Not only scientists have tried to create or to detect regular patterns in various contexts. The world, however, is full of irregular structures, like those of cancer cells, galaxies or motion curves of microscopic particles. Scientists, especially mathematicians, have tried to uncover hidden laws which govern the generation of irregularities.The IRTG concentrates on advanced techniques from the mathematical field of Analysis together with latest developments in neighboring fields such as Mathematical Physics, Geometry or Probability Theory. The focus will be on the mathematical analysis of problems which generically exhibit singular features or randomness. The topics in which the search for the regular in the irregular will be conducted include nonlinear wave equations, integro-differential equations, oscillator models, random matrices, generalized Dirichlet and magnetic energy forms, analysis on manifolds and fractal metric spaces. The initiative involves 19 internationally renowned experts from Germany and South Korea in the aforementioned fields who commit themselves to the education and the training of doctoral students coming from all over the world.The IRTG offers a broad mathematical education on the one hand and fascinating research projects under the supervision of experts on the other hand. After having attained a solid basis through four Introductory Lectures students will work in one of the four research areas into which the research program on singular and random systems is structured. These four areas are reflected in more specialized Topics Lectures leading up to recent developments of international research.The involvement of researchers from two universities on two different continents allows the IRTG to offer a well-rounded qualification program centered around mathematical analysis. During joint workshops in 2013, 2014, and 2015 it became clear that the complementary expertise in research and education in both departments provides a unique and strong basis for the proposed initiative. During their exchange stays the doctoral students will have the unique opportunity to work at one of Asia's leading universities resp. at a leading European center of innovative mathematical research and to experience the stimulating diversity of scientific cultures. \",\n",

It holds the record for the coordinated use of 80,000 CPU cores to solve a single mixed-integer optimization problem. As such it bears high relevance in two aspects: first, for algorithmic research at the interface of applied mathematics and computer science in the context of rapidly evolving parallel hardware architectures; second, for the solution of complex optimization problems for which sequential algorithms currently fall flat.Most immediately, the goal of the proposed project is to improve the usability and visibility of the Ubiquity Generator framework, and to enable its long-term, sustainable development by defining clear workflows for software development that facilitate the interaction of a larger group of distributed developers and users. Its application in future research projects shall be facilitated by the development of a template for a data management plan that adheres to the standards of good scientific practice specified by DFG and other funding agencies.On a broader scope, the project aims at achieving these goals by creating general infrastructures and formulating best practices not only for UG, but for other academic software projects in the field of high performance computing, optimization, and beyond. This includes in particular the development of citation recommendations and metadata schemes implementing the international standards of the FORCE11 initiative, experimentation with an OAIS-compliant digital preservation system for source code, and the extension of the widely-used library platform OPUS for publishing versioned software.

This measurement for the visual complexity of a graph hasalready been studied quite extensively for planar graphs. But whatabout 1-planar graphs, that is, graphs that can be drawn such thateach edge can cross at most one other edge? If we know that such agraph actually has a straight-line drawing with at most one crossingper edge, can we non-trivially bound the number of line segments thatwe need for such a drawing? Can we get better bounds in 3-space,where crossings are not much of an issue?The plane cover number that we introduced recently serves as ashowcase example, too: every planar graph has a crossing-freestraight-line drawing in the plane. If we leave, however, the realmof planar graphs, how many planes do we need to accommodate acrossing-free straight-line drawing of a given graph? Consideralmost-planar graphs, that is, graphs that becomes planar after theremoval of a single edge. While crossing minimization is NP-hard evenfor almost-planar graphs, we know that we can draw any almost-planar graph on the union of four planes (or, trivially, two spheres).

       " 'Modern applications of control theory to chemical reactors, traffic networks, multi-body systems (e.g. robotic arms, flexible elements in aircraft), fluid-structure interactions, etc. require methods for robust stabilization of coupled heterogeneous systems, described by partial differential equations (PDEs). The complexity of such systems, the necessity to apply controls only to the boundary of their spatial domain, and the need to ensure efficiency and reliability of a control design in spite of actuator and observation errors and external disturbances, make the stabilization of coupled PDE systems a highly challenging problem. To approach this problem, we base ourselves on the input-to-state stability (ISS) theory, which plays a prominent role in robust nonlinear control theory. ISS unifies the notions of uniform asymptotic stability and external (input-output) stability, and provides powerful methods to study the stability of coupled nonlinear control systems by means of Lyapunov and small-gain methods. The ISS theory of infinite-dimensional systems was intensively developing during the last five years and has evolved into a powerful interdisciplinary theory exploiting methods from nonlinear systems theory, partial differential equations and operator and semigroup theories. In this proposal, we develop tools for the systematic design of robust boundary feedback controllers for linear and nonlinear PDEs and for interconnections of heterogeneous distributed parameter systems with boundary couplings. This will be achieved via the synergy of ISS theory for distributed parameter systems with the methods for controller design for partial differential equations with boundary controls.We proceed in several steps. First, we radically improve the available toolkit for ISS analysis of boundary control systems and time-delay systems. We extend the applicability of the classical Lyapunov and Lyapunov-Krasovskii methods and develop a brand-new methodology of non-coercive Lyapunov functions as well as apply methods of monotone control systems. We apply our results to several important classes of nonlinear PDEs, including parabolic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, hyperbolic systems and nonlinear KdV equation. Next, we combine the developed ISS Lyapunov theory for boundary control systems with the methods to design boundary controllers for PDE systems, most notably with PDE backstepping technique.Finally, we combine the obtained results with the small-gain methodology to study the robust stabilization problem for the coupled heterogeneous systems, including interconnections of ordinary and partial differential equations (so-called ODE-PDE cascades) and couplings of time-delay and PDE equations (delay-PDE cascades).

       " 'Ultrashort pulse lasers with high pulse energies are predestined for micro- and nanostructuring, since the specific interaction with matter makes use of phenomena that are not possible with conventionally longer laser pulses. A disadvantage of fs lasers is that due to the high intensities either oscillators with low pulse energies and high repetition rates or alternatively complex amplifier systems with high energies but low repetition frequencies can be used. In contrast, laser systems with pulse durations in the ps range can optimally combine both parameters in a comparatively simple configuration, whereby the machining quality is slightly impaired depending on the investigated materials. The intended beam source with pulses in the ps range enables a wavelength conversion (2ω and 3ω). By better resolution and a more optimal adaptation to the material (high photon energy at shorter wavelengths), the disadvantages compared to fs lasers can be largely compensated. Future research projects will focus on the fundamental interactions of ps laser pulses of different wavelengths with metals and in particular polymers. In the medium term, the limits in the direction of miniaturization should be further shifted by one order of magnitude. Furthermore, the source should be used to selectively generate nanoparticles and embed them in polymers.',\n",

Detailed, large-scale investigations of these form-based components of grammar by cooperative research projects have arguably been neglected in recent years in Germany, but internationally the general area of research has gained substantial momentum as a consequence of new developments. These developments have accumulated an impressive body of knowledge about (i) the representations of linguistic expressions of varying complexity (from signal to sentence), and (ii) the grammatical building blocks (i.e., rules, operations, constraints, schemata, extralinguistic factors) that restrict the distributions of linguistic expressions. In addition, there are some plausible – and, as in the case of Optimality Theory, sometimes widely adopted – hypotheses as to how the grammatical building blocks that have been postulated interact with one another.However, a comprehensive, systematic investigation of the possible interactions of grammatical Building blocks from different theoretical perspectives, on the basis of a multitude of detailed empirical studies of phonological, morphological, and syntactic phenomena from typologically different languages, and by invoking all available research techniques (introspective, experimental, corpus-based) is so far outstanding.The individual research projects of the IGRA take as their starting point a taxonomy that distinguishes between excitatory interaction and inhibitory interaction on the one hand, and between simultaneous interaction and sequential interaction on the other hand. Cross-classification then yields four types of interaction:(i) excitatory sequential interaction of building blocks: feeding, counter-bleeding; (ii) inhibitory sequential interaction of building blocks: bleeding, counter-feeding; (iii) inhibitory simultaneous interaction of Building blocks: competition (disjunctive blocking, conflict); and (iv) excitatory simultaneous interaction of Building blocks: cooperation.All four kinds of interaction are covered by the expertise of several members of the Research Training Group; and they are all deeply grounded in the concept of the structured Training programme.In the first funding period, we have tackled some fundamental questions and investigated a number of indvidual problems. Against this background, research in the second funding period will focus on eight areas: (i) domains, (ii) representations, (iii) iterativity, (iv) cumulativity, (v) frequency, (vi) analogy, (vii) exceptions, (viii) synthesis.

       " 'Specialized herbivores are found in a wide variety of mammal groups. What they all have in common is the development of morphologically different, but the same function specialized, molars, which allow efficient food comminution and thus a high daily energy intake with fiber-rich food. This reaches its maximum in mammals during lactation, in which the food intake of the lactating animal always increases significantly and thus the masticatory apparatus is the most stressed. In this project, the correlations between the formation of the chewing apparatus in herbivores, the chewing behavior, the resulting feed reduction and the resulting energy gain are quantified in a comparative approach. Based on the fecal particle size determined with similar feed, it is possible to conclude on the crushing capacity of the various herbivores. For selected species, the influence of lactation on particle size reduction is recorded. With the help of these data, in vitro fermentation simulates the influence of the comminution of food on the energy gain (extent and speed of digestion) in the various herbivore groups and during the course of lactation. In addition, the energy required for comminuting plant material (comminuting resistance) for different coarse feeds should also be estimated.',\n",
       " 'The pelvis is of great functional importance in tetrapods in supporting a large part of the body weight, providing a rigid connection between the hindlimbs and the vertebral column, and providing insertion areas for important limb muscles. Three pelvic types are distinguished in dinosaurs, referring to a cranial (propubic), ventral (mesopubic), or caudal (opisthopubic) orientation of the pubis. The development of these different pelvic shapes from dinosauromorphs to dinosaurs could never be satisfyingly explained. Pelvis shapes in dinosauromorphs and basal dinosaurs will therefore be analyzed by the innovative technique of Finite Element Structure Synthesis (FESS), which allows precise identification of shape-forming mechanical influences on the pelvis. Thereby, different hypotheses about soft-tissue reconstructions and the distribution of mechanical stresses acting on the pelvis during rest, locomotion, and ventilation, can be tested. Extant crocodylians and birds will provide the basis for comparisons in an Extant Phylogenetic Bracket approach, and will be used for a validation of the novel technique of FESS prior to the analysis of dinosaurian pelves. The results will be discussed under the aspects of evolutionary history and functional morphology. This integrative approach will help to better understand the consequences of the development of different pelvis shapes in dinosaurs for their locomotion and ecology. ',\n",
       " 'Interactions among species are one of the most important drivers of the ecology and evolution of species. Throughout the last years, interesting insights into Palaeogene plant/insect associations from selected European localities (Messel, Eckfeld, Enspel) have been obtained. However, one component that was completely disregarded in all of these studies so far are the insect/flower associations. Because of their outstanding preservation quality of not just flowers and insects, but also direct evidence such as pollen-matching and gut content, the investigated localities offer world-wide unique requirements to study insect/flower associations. These are multifaceted and can be examined from botanical, entomological, ecological and evolutionary viewpoints that are often summarised under the heading of pollination biology.

In this project, will combine for the first time quantitative studies of Palaeogene antagonistic and mutualistic associations between insects and their consumed/visited fowers from temperate ecosystems to answer following questions: To which extend does the fossil record of Palaeogene flowers reveal patterns relevant to insect pollination and angiosperm radiation and angiosperm success? Can the fossil data support an evaluation of mutualism in deep time coupled with morphological traits of the insects and flowers themselves? How stable are specific mutualistic relationships over geological time?

       " 'In 2009, Expedition 323 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) recovered the first continuous sediment cores from the Bering Sea extending back 5 Million years. The unique IODP core material has considerable potential to unlock the environmental and climatic history of the Bering Sea. The Bering Sea is a large, yet poorly explored natural laboratory to study the development of climate-relevant biogeochemical element cycles in a high-productivity semi-restricted upwelling system on glacial-interglacial time scales. Moreover, the Bering Sea is of global relevance (a) due to its potential for atmospheric CO2 sequentation and its burial in the sea floor as organic matter over long time scales, and (b) due to the export of low-oxygen high-nutrient glacial water to the North Pacific and related effects on productivity, stratification, and carbon burial in the world´s largest ocean basin. Our main goal is to decipher biogeochemical dynamics and coupling that have hardly been studied both in the Bering Sea and globally so far, but may be of importance for atmosphere- ocean CO2 exchange and thus for climate dynamics on glacial-interglacial time scales: The feedbacks between primary productivity, middle and deep redox conditions, and nutrient recycling from the sediment. We will focus on sediments from two sites representative for the environmental regimes of the Bering Sea, namely open marine Site U1341, and Site U1343 at the continental slope. We will construct inorganic geochemical sediment records (Ba, Fe, P, redox-sensitive trace metals) to trace nutrient, productivity and ocean redox variations over the past 2-5 million years, but also to quantify diagenetic processes that affected primary environmental signals. To evaluate the effects of Pliocene- Pleistocene biogeochemical dynamics and interactions on a more global scale, we will compare our records from the Bering Sea to published data and interpretations from the North Pacific (e.g. ODP Leg 145). In summary, our main research topics are: 1. The development of bioproductivity and related carbon burial.2. The dynamics and coupling of Fe and P under variable redox conditions.3. The effects of early diagenesis on primary geochemical sediment signals.4. The relation between Pliocene-Pleistocene geochemical conditions in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. ',\n",
       " 'Turtles are unique among vertebrates in that they possess a bony shell under which they can withdraw their heads and necks. In pleurodiran turtles, the head and neck are folded along the horizontal plane below the shell, whereas in cryptodiran turtles, the head and neck are retracted inside the shell between the shoulder girdles. Although the neck retraction mechanisms of living turtles are generally wellunderstood, virtually nothing is known about the evolution of neck mobility among fossil turtles and the origin of these mechanisms thus remains unclear. To complement what is known about the muscle system of extant turtles, I propose as the first step to sample the remaining tree space by dissecting the necks of four extant turtles. Within a phylogenetic framework, this will allow reconstructing the muscle system of the hypothetical turtle ancestor. For the second step, I propose investigating the mechanical constraints that the musculoskeletal system imposes on the necks of extant turtles, by documenting the maximum allowed flexibility of fresh turtle necks using x-ray photography. With the data obtained from the first and second step, it then will be possible to 3D model the neck movement of several well-preserved fossil taxa that will have been CT or laser scanned for that purpose and to synthesize the evolution of neck retraction mechanisms in turtles.

       " \"Approximately 90% of the seismic moment on Earth is released in often devastating subduction zone earthquakes (EQs). In the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (lODP), the study of seismogenesis along an active convergent margin plays a key role in the form of a multi-expedition effort named 'NanTroSEIZE' (Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment). To date, eight expeditions (lODP Expeditions 314-316, 319, 322, 326, 332-333) drilled 12 sites along a transect from the incoming plate across the frontal accretionary prism to the forearc basin. In the near future, the deepest hole will tap into the seismogenic portion of the subduction megathrust using Riser drilling. The proponent participated in three of the NanTroSEIZE expeditions, most recently as co-chief scientist overseeing the successful recovery of a mini-CORK and the installation of a mini-CORK and a full CORK observatory (Exp 332). This proposal aims lo reach two major scientific milestones:(i) In addition to the German component of the lODP borehole observatory network (i.e. mini- CORKs during Legs 319 and 332 plus some contribution to the full CORK), we want to extend the long-term monitoring efforts to active mud volcanoes some 30 km landward of Site C0009. These features carry gas hydrates and deep-seated fluids, most likely tapping into the seismogenic zone at a depth of several km below seafloor, and are also overlying an area of high strains and a locked plate boundary-thrust.(ii) The second goal is to develop a smart MeBo (MARUM Meeresboden-Bohrgerät) CORK observatory to be installed in two of these mud volcanoes. These observatories will be self-contained and monitor pore pressure and temperature as proxies for strain and fluid flow near terminal depth of the borehole. Their hydraulic lines can further be used for geochemical (osmo-sampler) and microbiological (FLOCS units) monitoring and sampling.The underlying reason for the engineering effon of smart observatories for MeBo is founded in the new lODP Science Plan where specialist rigs such as MeBo are discussed as ECORD's contribution from 2013-2023. So far, CORKs or other sophisticated long-term devices were restricted to DVs Joides Resolution and Chikyu, however, we here present an affordable solution for versatile, multi-disciplinary MeBo borehole instruments. The proposed system is to be installed by MeBo alone and data can be retrieved by ships of opportunity. A seafloor extension, to be deployed and recovered by ROVs (during and/or after the anticipated lODP expedition) can add capability and payload, and hence represent the means for more than decade of monitoring. Data recovery will be from ships of opportunity and hence frequently possible.Funding for MeBo drilling and ROV installations in the Nankai mud volcano field has already been granted (RV Sonne cruise SO222 in summer 2012) and is brought into the project as in kind contribution. \",\n",
       " 'Here, we propose a web-based, open-access, digital resource introduced here as the Digital Integrated Stratigraphy Project (DISP). The premise behind the DISP is to eliminate stratigraphic ambiguity associated with sample position within a stratigraphic section. For example, it is often difficult to compare one author’s measured section and data against another author’s geographically identical measured section and data as there are often discrepancies in the thicknesses of units, the assignments of litho- and chronostratigraphic terms, and/or the precise line of measured sections between authors. The DISP will provide a solution to this problem by producing a precise digital rendering of the outcrop using LIDAR and overlain digital photography to produce a cm to mm-scale accurate digital version of a given outcrop globally referenced by global navigation satellite positioning (GNSS). Once available online as shown at www.utdallas.edu/igeology , where a series of digital outcrops in Oklahoma are accessible, researchers could access the program and digital models. We also have the means to log their sample positions online directly onto the digital outcrop using a methodology where a user could attribute on an outcrop model by working on the 2D images thus allowing unambiguous stratigraphic reference for future research. The proposed project will serve as a proof-of-concept for the DISP with a limited initial goal of addressing the six Silurian Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) located within Wales and England.

       " \"Funds are requested for mineralogical and geochemical studies of basalt alteration and the involvement of microorganisms, using drill core samples and incubation slides. Rock samples were recovered during IODP Expedition 336 from the North Pond area on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. North Pond is representative of the globally most abundant, cold and wellventilated ridge flanks. These systems play a pivotal role in setting the chemistry of the oceans, yet, the hydrogeological-geochemical-microbiological couplings controling the rates and magnitudes of chemical exchange are very poorly understood. Expedition 336 installed seafloor observatories that will allow sampling formation fluids, facilitate incubation experiments, and provide insights into subbasement microbiological activities in the forthcoming years. The supplemental analyses of drill core material proposed here include geochemical and x-ray microtomography studies as well as electron- and raman-microcopy investigations. Collaborating scientists in the US will conduct x-ray absorption spectroscopy and molecular microbiological studies using splits of the same materials. The project's primary goal is a detailed and comprehensive description of basalt glass alteration in young ocean crust. One focus is on identifying alteration features believed to be related to microbial activity and collect further evidence for their biogenicity. Geochemical investigations of altered materials and their primary precursor phases will provide information on the direction and magnitude of chemical changes during seawater circulation and the associated alteration of basaltic crust. Trace element and stable isotopic compositions of mineral precipitates are used as a recorder of fluid composition and conditions of fluid-rock interaction. These results will be compared with direct observations on fluid composition and temperature in the borehole. Merging observations and data from the proposed study with those to be obtained by our cooperators and our joint efforts during the next years of observatory studies at North Pond will allow us to obtain fundamentally novel insights into ridge flank processes and their role in exchange budgets between lithosphere, hydrophere, and biosphere in the oceanic realm. \",\n",
       " 'Despite the great diversity and particular ecological importance of modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and idiots), the relationships and origins of modern groups of fossil precursors remain one of the most controversial topics in modern vertebrate systematics. Three phylogenetic hypotheses are currently being discussed in the literature, all of which have repeatedly been the subject of modern analytical approaches and supported by different data. Nevertheless, or perhaps because of this, the controversy persists and has direct influence on many areas of the life sciences in which amphibians play a central role, such as ecology, evolution, biomedicine, and species conservation. This highlights the particular need for new data that can help resolve the conflict. This interdisciplinary nature of the problem, the large fossil and recent diversity of amphibians and their ontogenetic plasticity make them an excellent model group for an interdisciplinary approach to gaining a comprehensive insight into the long evolutionary history of this vertebrate group. The integrative research project presented here addresses key issues in the evolutionary history of amphibians from a paleontological, morphological, and molecular perspective: (1) Salamanders have the best fossil record of all modern amphibians. A detailed morphological and phylogenetic study of Mesozoic and Cenozoic salamanders will investigate the controversial relationships and especially the origin of salamanders. Collection-based studies will be complemented by fieldwork in the Triassic and Jurassic of North and Central Asia to fill critical gaps in the fossil record and provide insight into the transition from Paleozoic to modern groups. (2) Salamander limb development shows a unique pattern within the tetrapods. The genetic basis for this aberrant pattern is poorly understood but can provide key data on the origin of modern salamanders in particular, as well as the evolution of tetrapod extremity in general. (3) Within vertebrates, amphibians have by far the largest genomes with an additional strong variability in genome size between different taxa. It is generally known that genome size has a direct influence on development, metabolism and organ complexity. However, the evolutionary history of the large genomes in amphibians is still largely unexplored and may contribute essential data to understanding evolutionary, developmental, and phylogenetic patterns. The three subprojects are highly interconnected and results from each area will directly contribute data to the analysis and understanding of the other subprojects. The goal is to generate a coherent, new dataset that will allow us to better understand the origins and evolution of amphibians through time.',\n",
       " 'Ornithopod dinosaurs are one of the most successful radiations of Mesozoic vertebrates, consisting of obligatory to facultative bipedal and digitigrade animals that colonized every continent over a 100 million years time span. Ornithopods are an important grout because: i) understanding how they achieved their cosmopolitan distribution may help elucidate how geological events affected the evolution and distribution of terrestrial faunas; ii) the abundance and high quality of their fossil record allows for studying how reptilian anatomy relates to biomechanical function and ecology; iii) and the large sample sizes and growth series available for various species allow for studying how anatomical variation relates to species recognition, reproductive behavior, intraspecific variation, ontogeny, and population biology. These questions can be best approached in a phylogenetic context to provide an all-encompassing evolutionary understanding for the group. However, a well-resolved and robust phylogeny of these animals does not exist. The core goal of this project is two-fold: providing a well-resolved and robust phylogeny of ornithopod dinosaurs and using this phylogeny for addressing a number of questions on the evolutionary biology of these animals. These goals will be reached in five phases. Phase 1: comparative anatomy and morphometric character analysis for the recognition and documentation of new phylogenetically informative characters, as well as re-evaluation of previously known ones; the basal iguanodontian ornithopod Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki will serve as a model for understanding how each element and anatomical region of the skeleton changes throughout ontogeny and also among individuals of the same age/ontogenetical stage. Phase 2: taxonomic revision of poorly known taxa based on the information provided by phase 1 and first hand examination of specimens. Phase 3: integration of results from phases 1 and 2 for creating a taxon-character state matrix for phylogenetic analysis. Phase 4: phylogenetic inference of the interrelationships of ornithopod species via maximum parsimony analysis. Phase 5: usage of the phylogeny derived from phase 4 for addressing questions on the palaeobiology and evolutionary history of ornithopods: which attributes drove the diversification of these animals? How did body size evolve in Ornithopoda? Could any changes in body size be correlated with the evolution of other morphological characters and/or other factors (e.g., paleoenvironmental, etc)? Where did ornithopods originate and how did they achieve their cosmopolitan distribution? Finally, the phylogeny will also be used for soft-tissue and biomechanical inferences on functional morphological aspects of ornithopod anatomy, setting the groundwork for more in-depth future research on the functional morphology of various character complexes (e.g., feeding-related characters, locomotion-related characters, etc.) of these dinosaurs.

       " 'This proposal was inspired by the inherent limitations in the quantification of the physical parameters (e.g., flow speed and grain shape) controlling sediment-fluid interactions in the direct vicinity of the sediment water interface and in the interior of a sediment bed. For investigation of the processes influencing the erosion characteristics of sediments beds, researchers commonly tested the transport behavior sediment beds empirically using laboratory flume tanks or in situ field investigations. However, a precise quantification of the processes occurring in the direct vicinity and in the interior of the sediment body, such as the fluid infiltration rates into the sediment bed, is difficult when using these techniques. Therefore, the physical processes in the interior of a sediment bed require further investigation. With a focus on the physical processes, occurring in the direct vicinity and in the interior of a sediment bed, the overall goal of this proposed research is to identify and quantify the role of fluid infiltration and grain shape variations on the transport behavior of sediments beds using 3D numerical simulations. It is hypothesized that: (1) the grain shapes found in natural sediment beds effect the amount of flow available to infiltrate into a sediment bed. (2) the textural bed composition (round versus non-round shapes) controls the inflow rates into a sediment bed and, hence, the erosion characteristics, and (3) natural grain shapes in sediment beds influence the erosion characteristics of sediment beds. By the use of the numerical Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, uniform sediment beds composed of different grain shapes, will be tested in a 3D numerical flume tank under different current velocities. Physical features, such as the role of fluid inflow and grain shape variations on the transport characteristics will be measured at high resolution in the direct vicinity and in the interior of the sediment beds.

       " 'Theropod dinosaurs represent one of the most conspicuous components of Mesozoic vertebrate faunas and, in the form of birds, account for approximately one third of modern tetrapods. Recent research has demonstrated that theropods underwent an explosive radiation during the Jurassic, and most important lineages were established during this time. The main lineage radiating during this period are the tetanurans, which include well-known fossil forms, such as Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus or Velociraptor, but also the birds. Tetanurans first appear in the early Middle Jurassic, and by the end of the period, all major lineages are established. However, especially the Middle Jurassic record of theropod dinosaurs is extremely poor, and most basal tetanuran taxa are represented by very incomplete material. Consequently, the early evolution and the phylogenetic interrelationships between basal tetanurans are still poorly understood. Recent fieldwork in the early Middle Jurassic (Aalenian-Bajocian) of Chubut Province, Argentina, resulted in the discovery of a partial theropod skeleton, including an almost complete skull, presacral vertebral column, forelimbs, and partial hindlimbs. This specimen represents the most complete basal tetanuran recovered from the Middle Jurassic and shows a unique combination of characters, including features that were hitherto considered apomorphic for different clades or even different species of basal tetanurans. The objective of the current project is thus a detailed description and analysis of this new basal tetanuran to evaluate its impact on our understanding of basal tetanuran evolution. We will describe and document the new taxon in detail and elaborate a large phylogenetic dataset, including several recently published phylogenetic matrices for basal theropods. The inclusion of the new taxon and the analysis of this matrix will result in new insights into the interrelationships of basal tetanurans as well as character distribution and homoplasy levels at the base of this important theropod lineage.

       " 'The plesiomorphic molariform pattern of stem-mammals (mammaliaforms) is the triconodont condition, with an anterior-posterior alignment of the three main cusps. This molariform pattern characterizes basal mammaliaforms such as the morganucodontids with a purported insectivorous nutrition. From these basal triconodonts on one hand the evolutionary lineage with a reversed triangle pattern of molar cusps emerged, leading to modern mammals with tribosphenic teeth. This cusp arrangement of alternating triangles was predisposition for the highly differentiated dentitions of modern mammals. On the other hand, the eutriconodont lineage maintained the triconodont pattern without triangulation and further refined it. Eutriconodonts were the first mammals to develop a carnivorous adaptation by a precise occlusion of upper and lower teeth. They were successful up to the Late Cretaceous and the largest Mesozoic mammals belonged to this group (Repenomamus with up to 15 kg body mass). With the innovative Occlusal Fingerprint Analyser software tool that has been developed by our DFG research unit 771 the chewing cycle of triconodonts can be modeled three dimensionally for the first time. By a quantification of tooth contact areas during mastication the efficiency of the various tooth and types can be estimated. The aim of the project is to analyse the functional transformation from the insectivorous dentition of basal triconodonts to the carnivorous adaptation of Eutriconodonta by high resolution 3D models and a striation- and microtexture-analysis of the occlusal surfaces. Using the Occlusal Fingerprint Analyser software the mastication cycle will be modelled for the first time. Hypotheses on insectivrous and carnivorous feeding adaptations will be tested by comparison with dentitions of extant mammals. The aim of the project is besides an in-depth understanding of evolution of mastication in mammals an insight in the role of triconodonts in Mesozoic vertebrate communities. ',\n",
       " 'The relevance of physiology in studies of climate change effects on marine ectotherms and ecosystems is currently constrained by limited availability of quantitative links between physiological phenomena and ecosystem level processes. Such evidence is still scarce for the present, and even more so for the deep past. The proposed project BivCRS2 wants to fill this gap by identifying the quantitative contribution of those mechanisms that shape and limit the time dependent survival under extreme conditions. Clearly, an understanding of mechanisms can only be derived from extant fauna, assuming that those mechanisms are still in place that have shaped the fate of fauna in the deep past, explaining the patterns and irreversibility of faunal losses under progressive environmental change. A limited number of studies have in fact established clear links between, on the one hand, field studies reporting a climate-induced effect on species at ecosystem level and, on the other hand, laboratory studies establishing the reasons for such an effect. In addition to the effects of temperature and its extremes, laboratory studies and consecutive meta-analyses have revealed vulnerability of marine fauna to extreme hypoxia and ocean acidification, with extreme hypoxia having an effect as strong as temperature at extremes outside of the thermal range of species. Temperature and hypoxia extremes are thus candidates to cause short term lethal impacts, however, they also have combined effects. The main goal of BivCRS2 within phase 2 is to increase predictive power for characterizing unifying principles of species responses to climatic changes and to quantify the mechanisms underpinning different and specific vulnerabilities of species groups. In the context of palaeo-patterns research in BivCRS2 will therefore address why and how species are specialized on limited but different temperature ranges, why and at what temperatures they are sensitive to accumulating CO2 and along the same lines, how they deal with ambient oxygen deficiency. Phase 1 compares(d) the capacities of oysters and scallops to sustain fitness actively. Phase 2 will address their passive tolerance capacity, the set of mechanisms underpinning such capacity, with a view on the implications for the time limitation of tolerance to environmental extremes. The focus is on how, beyond pejus limits of the thermal window, interactions of warming, acidification, and hypoxia (“deadly trio“) may shift limits and capacities of tolerances, e.g. through metabolic depression, shifting acid-base parameters, and exploitation of antioxidative defence, energy reserves and mode, and capacity of anaerobic metabolism. Reduced functional scope may cause a narrowing of active thermal tolerance with the potential benefit of expressed and extended passive tolerance. ',\n",
       " 'Mesosaurs are a unique and very specialized vertebrate group, representing the first fully aquatic amniotes. Mesosaurids are commonly considered to belong to Parareptilia, although some studies suggest that they represent basal sauropsids outside of the split between parareptiles and eureptiles. They are exclusively known from the early Permian of southern Gondwana. However, despite their restricted stratigraphic and geographic range, they represent an important step in the evolutionary history of tetrapods: being highly specialized for an aquatic lifestyle by having a long skull with an extremely elongate snout, spiked with long and thin conical teeth, a slender neck, a long flattened tail for laterally undulating movements, and paddle-like fore and hind limbs. Only three monotypic mesosaurid genera are currently recognized as valid: Mesosaurus tenuidens, Stereosternum tumidum, and Brazilosaurus sanpauloensis. Although they represent a key group in the early evolutionary history of amniotes, mesosaurids are quite poorly known, despite some recent research advances on M. tenuidens. The main objectives of the proposed project comprise a detailed anatomical investigation of the remaining mesosaurids Stereosternum and Brazilosaurus using modern 3D imaging technologies from CT data to reveal new phylogenetic characters to test existing hypotheses about their inter- and intrarelationships. The planned 3D reconstruction of the general mesosaurid skull anatomy aims to resolve the controversial and historical question of whether the skull condition of mesosaurids is anapsid or synapsid. The proposed 3D analysis of the skull (including its internal cranial structures such as the braincase, cranial endocast and inner ear) aims to further fill a gap in our knowledge, and yield important data to understand the early evolution of the amniote skull. Moreover, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) will be applied to skulls of Stereosternum and Brazilosaurus and compared to other extant and fossil secondarily aquatic tetrapods to test their respective bite power and skull resistance and to test whether there are differences in feeding behaviour (filter-feeders vs. active predators) and locomotion among the mesosaurid taxa. Finally, a thorough ontogenetic study with special focus on overall postcranial (but also cranial) proportions, applying a morphometric approach including linear measurements as well as geometric morphometrics aims to investigate potential variations in the growth patterns of mesosaurids, and hence whether there was a difference in feeding behaviour between juvenile and adult mesosaurids. The results of this research promise novel insights into the palaeobiology of these earliest secondarily aquatic amniotes. ',\n",
       " 'Understanding the interplay between brittle and ductile deformation mechanisms at the grain scale in mylonites is essential for understanding shear localization at depth in the continental crust. This interplay also has a strong influence on the length-scale and velocity of fluid transfer below the base of the seismogenic crust, and on the seismic cycle itself. The main goal of the project is to understand the origin of discrete zones of recrystallization (DZR) in quartz as potential indicators of microfracturing during the incipient stages of mylonitization. Such structures are developed in quartz veins from the Schober Group (Hohe Tauern mountains in the Central Eastern Alps), which were deformed at c. 450-500°C, and will be used as a key study. More generally, the project aims to improve the understanding on interaction of different deformation mechanisms (micro-fracturing, subgrain rotation and grain boundary migration, mechanical Dauphiné twinning, dissolution-precipitation, grain boundary sliding) during the initial formation of DZR structures and, how their significance changes with progressive development of the mylonitic and ultramylonitic microstructures. Without an integrated approach, using different up-to-date techniques of high-resolution microstructural and microchemical (trace element) analysis, interpretations of the quartz deformation microstructures detailed above are destined to remain speculative. The project includes integrated micro- and nano-analyses on fine-grained microstructures by means of: electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), SEM orientation contrast imaging (channeling contrast), SEM cathodoluminescence (CL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS and NanoSIMS) for Ti-in-Quartz analysis. Additional, new developments in high resolution analysis (down to atomic scale) by atom probe will be applied to obtain information about (sub)grain-scale diffusion processes (especially of Ti) during localized rock deformation. Furthermore this project will test the applicability of a newly developed Near Field Microscope with NanoFTIR capability to detect intragranular water in quartz at nano- to micrometer scales. This test will be accompanied by (OH- molecular ions) analysis in quartz using NanoSIMS technique. If these two independent methods prove successful, it will open up a new era of measuring water in fine-grained minerals (not only quartz) and, further, could specifically address the measurement of water along grain boundaries, subgrain boundaries and even dislocations structures. Combined with the Ti distribution analysed by the atom probe, this would help in recognizing processes such as dislocation pipe diffusion or diffusion along subgrain boundaries and their effects on the resetting of the Ti-in-Quartz system.

       " 'The worlds largest and likely most famous ammonite is Parapuzosia seppenradensis from the Campanian (Upper Cretaceous) of the Münsterland region in Germany. This giant was approx. 2.30 metres in diameter and was discovered 120 years ago. Little is known on the specimen and the species, as giant Parapuzosia were considered to be extremely rare. During cooperation activities and fieldwork in north-eastern Mexican state of Coahuila, however, we discovered numerous specimens in official and private collections and also found the localities, from there these giants originate. Parapuzosia appears to be a common taxon there. Here we plan to investigate these localities in order to determine the precise stratigraphic range and the palaeoenvironmental conditions during deposition. A fine-scaled biostratigraphic framework will be established providing a layer-by-layer analysis of ammonites, inoceramids, planktic foraminifers and nannofossils, and we will further calibrate this zonation by isotope stratigraphy. A morphometric and a taphonomical investigation of collected and still embedded specimens will give insight into palaeobiological aspects of giant Parapuzosia. Juvenile and adult specimens can be compared for the first time with material from both Europe and North America. The faunal elements associated with Parapuzosia (e.g. other ammonites, inoceramids) in the Mexican sections will allow us to draw further conclusions on the faunal relations between both continents. Some of these taxa also show gigantism. We will therefore discuss the question, which environmental conditions allowed for the enormous size increase in various marine molluscs in the Santonian-Campanian transition. In addition, our data will be of interest for museums worldwide that display copies of this famous German fossil. In addition, the section may be one of the completest across the Santonian-Campanian boundary at all. ',\n",
       " 'It has long been recognized that in addition to their shape, bones also preserve their histological structure, giving rise to the field of vertebrate paleohistology. Bone is a composite material that consists of 70% by volume of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (inorganic phase; IP) and 30% of collagen (organic phase; OP), including other minor organic constituents, like the protein osteocalcin. During bone formation, both blood vessels and bone-forming cells become incorporated into the bone matrix, adding to the OP. During the fossilization of bone, the collagen part and most or all of the original hydroxyapatite (HAp) is replaced by fluorapatite (FAp). Thus, fossil bone is highly mineralized, largely consisting of FAp and diagenetic mineral fillings in the spaces of former blood vessels (vascular spaces). While it has been known since the 1960s that OP and bone proteins can be detected in fossil dinosaur bone, it has only recently been recognized by Mary Schweitzer that osteocyte remains and blood vessels can be liberated from well-mineralized fossil dinosaur bone by careful etching with weak organic acids. This discovery led to a controversy over the nature of the pliable organic remains as OP vs. biofilms produced by bone-degrading bacteria. Although the evidence now is in favor of original OP, based on various lines of evidence, this type of preservation requires independent confirmation. The applicant and co-workers have done extensive work on fossil bone, from the histological level down to the nanometer scale. Our group recently has attempted to reproduce the results of Schweitzer, but with a much greater temporal and environmental sample range. In a preliminary study, we were able to isolate osteocyte remains as old as the Early Permian (290 MA) and blood vessel remains from the Late Jurassic (150 MA). Remarkably, the fossil bone samples that preserved bone tissue are not from conservation deposits, but from normal fluvial and marine facies. We currently lack particular predictive factors for OP preservation, and the question remains as to the material nature of the OP found in fossil bone.Based on these consideratons, the aim of the current project is two-fold: first, to test the hypothesis that the OP dissolved out of fossilized bone represents altered osteocytes and blood vessels (vs. fossilized biofilms) and, second, to understand the processes that led to their preservation and to test hypotheses of which conditions are conducive to OP preservation in bone in general. This work will involve the integration of results obtained from natural fossils, from bone degradation experiments, and from alteration experiment and be conducted in collaboration with Prof. Geisler-Wierwille and Prof. Bierbaum. Project A2 will contribute significantly to understanding the process of fossilization of bone, possible microbial involvement, and the material nature of this ubiquitous kind of fossil. ',\n",
       " 'Silicification is the most important fossilization process for cellular preservation in plants, which can result in cells preserved in exquisite detail. Understanding this process has been of great interest for nearly a century, and it is now known that any substrate that is able to bring elevated silica into solution is capable of silicifying plant material. The silica-rich solution enters wood and initially preserves cells by templating a film on the cell walls. Currently, analytical techniques are routinely used to characterize the geochemistry involved in wood silicification. However, nearly all studies are concerned with wood silicification only after mineralization in the cells has already begun or been completed. Indeed, what is virtually unknown is the cellular and tissue pathway of aqueous silica into the tree before silica is precipitated in the wood cells. Here we present a cohesive analytical and experimental research program of four studies aimed at elucidating the tissue and cellular pathway of aqueous silica into wood and other woody tissues such as seed cones. The first study will determine the pathway of silica-laden water in four upright conifer saplings rooted on a sinter apron of a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. The second study will ascertain whether drip structures seeping out of 17-million year old trees in the Lesvos Petified Forest represent the silica-rich tree sap in the trees when they were still alive, implying that the trees were involved in self-mineralization of their cells. The third study will trace the pathway of silica into allchthonous logs, fossil wood and cones from the sediment substrate. The fourth study will consist of a series of laboratory experiments tracking the pathway of aqueous silica from cell to cell in wood tissues. Using water, powdered volcanic glass, and a heat source, incipient silicification will be produced in various conifer and angiosperm woods of various densities, with and without bark. Pivotal is the orientation of the wood tissue to the flow of aqueous silica. Experiments will also be carried out to induce silicification in branches with bark to show whether bark hinders the entry of silica.Cutting-edge technologies will be applied to the imaging, mapping, and analyzing of the distribution of silica, other minerals, and residual lignin on the micrometer and nanoscale levels. These mostly involve non-invasive, non-destructive methods of surface analysis such as include wave-dispersive X-ray analysis (WDX), confocal Raman spectroscopy (CHRS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), helium ion microscopy (HIM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF). High-resolution research will also be carried out using scanning electron microscopy, backscattered backscattered electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. ',\n",
       " 'The family of Dicraeosauridae (Jurassic-Cretaceous) is one of the most peculiar known sauropod groups. Dicraeosauridae comprises taxa from East Africa, South America and North America, which are mostly less than 10 m in body length and possess rather short necks with high neural spines. Dicraeosauridae are still poorly understood in terms of their systematics, evolutionary origin and biogeography, and biomechanics including ecology. Character coding is mostly restricted to Dicraeosaurus hansemanni from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru/Tanzania and Amargasaurus cazaui from the Early Cretaceous of Patagonia/Argentina. D. hansemanni is the only dicraeosaurid with enough cranial and mandibular elements known to allow for a 3D skull reconstruction. Because of the scientific importance of the genus Dicraeosaurus as name-bearing taxon and first described type for the family Dicraeosauridae, the well-preserved and anatomically diverse material of Dicraeosaurus from Tendaguru will undergo a thorough redescription and a first ICZN conforming taxonomic revision in this project. The revision of the material of Dicraeosaurus from Tendaguru will be taken as basis for devising a new character matrix and for coding for the first phylogenetic analysis centering on Dicraeosauridae. The phylogenetic analysis will also include all other taxa that have been unambiguously or ambiguously assigned to Dicraeosaurid. Because of the pivotal position of Dicraeosauridae at the base of Flagellicaudata, this work will contribute to a better understanding of the phylogeny of Diplodocoidea in general as well as to the development of certain character complexes within these groups. Detailed 3D reconstructions of head of D. hansemanni and the cervical vertebral column of various dicraosaurids will give new information about the spatial flexibility of the cervical vertebral column, allowing thereby conclusions about the feeding range of different species of dicraeosaurids in all three dimensions. A detailed reassessment of the pneumatic structures present in the vertebral column of Dicraeosauridae will be made and both the neck musculature and the muscular suspension of the neck from the shoulder girdle will be reconstructed in 3D. All of this information will be integrated into a detailed biomechanical study on the neck and shoulder region of dicraeosaurid sauropod. This new biomechanical model of the neck of Dicraeosauridae will provide precise information about the feeding strategy of these sauropods, their ecological diversity, and their feeding range, which is currently controversely discussed. Combined with paleoecological and paleoclimatological data, the new phylogeny of Dicraeosauridae will make a detailed characterization of the evolutionary history and biogeography of Dicraeosauridae possible.

       " 'The skulls of land vertebrates are characterized by a large diversity. Particularly the region behind the eye, the temporal region, shows considerable differences between major groups, such as mammals, lizards, birds, crocodiles, and frogs. The origin of this diversity - including diverse skull openings and marginal bone reductions - is rarely understood. Of particular interest are turtles that do not resample the skull shape of any living land vertebrate, although they were recently hypothesized to be closely related to extant reptilian groups.In order to understand the temporal skull region and the origin of turtles, a morphogenetic approach to study paleontological and developmental integrity is proposed.Primarily, the anatomy of the temporal region will be coded in a cladistic sense to reconstruct the evolution of this region. Therefore, fossil as well as embryological data will be observed. Geometric morphometric changes in evolution and development of the bones will be analyzed quantitatively to illustrate the pathways leading to either one morphotype and to infer phylogenetic and functional correlations.Micro-computed tomography and histological techniques will be applied to characterize the progress of bone development. Gene expression will be analyzed to illustrate embryonic skull anatomy before the bones begin to form.From a developmental perspective, shared ancestral and derived features will be detected that lead to either one morphotype. By studying fossil groups, which had an even larger diversity of the temporal region than extant groups do, detailed scenarios for the evolutionary changes will be detected. By characterizing the turtle morphotype, a precise phylogenetic conclusion will be drawn for the phylogenetic position of this group that has important impact to understand land vertebrate phylogeny as a whole. Moreover, the integration of genetic and bone development will allow a complex insight to head development in general. In this context, embryological malformations - as seen in humans - will be interpretable from a developmental perspective and their meaning for evolutionary changes will be derived. ',\n",
       " 'Representatives of Crocodylia, the group including modern-day alligators, caimans, crocodiles, and gharials, formed a major element of lowland ecosystems during the Paleogene and have an extensive fossil record accordingly. This makes them an excellent model clade for addressing a broad range of questions in macroevolution such as the environmental drivers of biodiversity in deep time. Of particular interest, is their biogeographic history as intercontinental dispersals played a major role in their diversification facilitated by the warm high-latitude climate of the Eocene. The Paleogene biogeographic history of crocodylians remains largely uncertain because phylogenies including fossils are instable due to limited sampling. The most critical issues include the markedly poor Paleogene fossil record of Asia, a continent that evidently had a major role in the evolution of Crocodylia based on present-day diversity alone. Another major factor is the limited utilization of molecular data in phylogenetic inference in combination with morphology from extant and extinct species. We here propose to extensively expand sampling by the addition of fossil data from undescribed Eocene crocodylians collected by the University of Tübingen during a DFG BO 1550/11-1, 2 - funded project in Vietnam. The abundance, exceptional preservation, and diversity (representing each of the three major extant lineages with several ontogenetic stages) makes this new fossil assemblage by far the most important among crocodylian faunas from the Paleogene of Asia. The new material ranks among the best-preserved fossils from North America and Europe thereby, for the first time, allowing meaningful comparisons of faunas across Laurasia. Novel osteological data from the Vietnamese taxa as well as key species from Europe and North America will be combined with molecular data in order to elucidate the early diversification and Laurasian biogeographic history of Crocodylia. The expected results will have important implications for intercontinental paleogeographic reconstruction and faunal interchange during the early Paleogene. ',\n",

A similar active plate-margin setting was repeatedly given since Precambrian times, as is documented by at least two sutures in the Cretan nappe stack. The Alpine Pindos suture separates the unmetamorphic Pindos Unit from the Uppermost Unit, the latter consisting of different nappes (Arvi, Vatos, Miamou, Spili, Preveli, Asteroussia), which differ considerably in age, type and grade of metamorphism. While an affiliation of the Uppermost Unit to the Internal Hellenides is beyond dispute, a Pelagonian provenance, as assumed by most workers, is not in line with (1) Middle Jurassic ophiolites in the Spili nappe, (2) Upper Jurassic blueschists in the Preveli nappe, and (3) Campanian arc-type granitoids in the Asteroussia nappe. Such rocks are lacking in the Pelagonian Zone, but are common in the Vardar, Serbomacedonian and Rhodope domains. To verify such a provenance and to reveal how the rocks of the Uppermost Unit succeeded to end up in Crete and Gavdos, are the main goals of present proposal. Our hypothesis can be tested by comparing the nappes of the Uppermost Unit with possible provenance domains concerning protolith age, age of metamorphism, cooling history and tectonometamorphic evolution. At present, however, the age and evolution of most nappes of the Uppermost Unit are still poorly constrained. For this reason the following investigations will be carried out on rocks of the Uppermost Unit exposed on Crete and Gavdos: (1) Microscopic, EBSD, µCT and microprope analyses of rocks of the Vatos and Spili groups focusing on the deformation microfabrics, finite and incremental strain, and crystallization-deformation relation to constrain the tectonometamorphic evolution and kinematics during nappe emplacement. (2) U-Pb dating (small-scale isochrones) of fluid-derived minerals (calcite, prehnite, epidote), which formed synkinematically in veins, strain fringes and shear zones to date the age of deformation. (3) U-Pb dating of metamorphic aragonite to constrain the age of HP-LT metamorphism. (4) U-Pb dating of zircons and titanite to constrain the age of protolith and metamorphism of the Preveli blueschists. (5) U-Pb dating of detrital zircons to determine the maximum age and provenance of metasediments of the Asteroussia, Vatos and Preveli nappes. The new results will be of interest for all workers dealing with the Alpine geodynamic evolution of the eastern Mediterranean. They will help to reveal the provenance area and the tectonometamorphic evolution of the Uppermost Unit, both of which are essential for post-Triassic map-view restorations of the eastern Mediterranean region.

       " 'The rich information on past extinctions provided by the fossil record is a key for understanding biotic responses to climate-related stresses. With recent acceleration in climate changes and rising concerns that a wave of marine extinctions may be imminent, such information on expected future threats is more important than ever. Paleontological and evolutionary studies indicate that the evolutionary history of taxa is important for predicting their fate when facing climate-related stresses. This intrinsic extinction risk is likely dependent on the long-term climatic context. More extinctions are expected from a temperature increase that adds to a previous geologically long period of warming than a similar warming event following a previous cooling period. Niche conservatism predicts that climatic changes are worse for species facing conditions increasingly different from the climate context of their ancestors. We thus hypothesize that temperature change interacts with long-term temperature trends when causing temperature-related extinctions. The temporal dimension of this signal from the past is expected to be lineage dependent but non-stochastic and can thus be used for predicting climate change effects on extant species. To test this hypothesis, survival and extinction of genera will be estimated from fossil occurrences available in the Paleobiology Database as well as other data sources. In a temporally continuous analysis, generalized linear mixed effects models with binomial family error will be implemented to explain survival and extinction by temperature changes interacting with long-term temperature trends and ancestral temperature niches. The approach has the advantage that it neither depends on a perfect fossil record nor on continuously reconstructed phylogenies and is thus highly suitable for the imperfect nature of deep-time biotic data. If funded, this project will quantify how evolutionary history can be used for predicting biotic responses to climate-related stresses and how this phylogenetic signal differs between taxonomic groups. Tracking species occurrence though time using the fossil record provides the unique opportunity to study the interaction between climate change, past climate trends and the phylogenetic history of species on extinction risk, while approaching this crucial question only with extant data is impossible. Results may have far reaching consequences for currently implemented paleontological models which evaluate the intrinsic risk of current warming to modern marine biota with models calibrated during the opposing long-term cooling trend of the last million years.

       " 'The Iberian Peninsula is one of the southern regions in Europe that saw the persistence of human and animal occupation over the climatic changes of the late Quaternary. In this project, we aim at investigating to which extant the different colder and warmer climatic episodes between ca. 40,000 and 10,000 years ago have impacted the ecology of the large herbivores, namely red deer (Cervus elaphus) and horse (Equus sp.) in this refuge area. We intend to use the amounts of stable isotopes in their bone collagen and tooth enamel to reconstruct their diet, habitat and some parameters of their environment. We consider three key periods in Europe, which are 1) around the Heinrich event 4 (ca. 40 kyr cal BP), 2) around the Last Glacial Maximum (27-23 kyr cal BP), and 3) after the Heinrich Event 1 (ca. 15.6 to 9.8 kyr cal BP). Each of these key time ranges corresponds to a major change in the climatic conditions that have triggered human and animal population turn over in Europe. The studied material consists of skeletal remains of red deer (67 bones and 40 teeth) and horse (53 bones and 30 teeth) coming from seven archaeological sites of mid-range altitudes (170 to 760 m asl). The stable isotopes (carbon-13 and nitrogen-15) of bone collagen from mature individuals deliver a long-term record of adult lifetime as a result of the constant bone remodelling. Carbon-13 informs on the forage preferences but also reflects conditions of humidity and closure of the habitat. Nitrogen-15 is an indicator of the diet (grazing versus browsing) and of the environment, such as the local temperature and conditions of humidity. The dietary and environmental influences can be disentangled by examining the intensity of the dental wear that depends mainly on the consumption of grasses versus leaves. Short time seasonal record of temperature and habitat can be obtained by the sequential analysis of oxygen-18 and carbon-13 over the tooth enamel, which does not remodel after the formation of the tooth. The isotopic sequence of the third molar should reflect the second winter of the life of the individual for the red deer, and one summer and one winter between the second and fourth year of the individual life of the horse. The results of this project will contribute to test two scenarios: 1) the adaptation of the herbivores to a changing environment through changes in habitat and diet thanks to their ecological flexibility or 2) the local buffering of the variation in climatic conditions allowing the species to persist without a significant change of their ecology. Ultimately, understanding how red deer and horse could cope with climatic changes (habitat, diet adaptation) in the past can help us to predict how tolerant will be these species to present-day and future environmental changes.

       " 'Information processing is currently dominated by complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Since the 1960s the advancements in electronics due to scaling of integration densities along MooreÂ’s law have established a general expectation for very short innovation cycles with ever-new application possibilities. Indeed, the huge advancement of electronics over the past decades has been the driving force for innovation in various application fields and has significantly shaped the world we live in today. As CMOS technology is reaching atomic boundaries, it increasingly fails to deal with the negative impacts on device behaviour due to shrinkage (short channel effects, leakage etc.), and MooreÂ’s law is projected to end. Thus, it is accepted that long-term innovation in electronics cannot be based solely on higher planar integration densities. Instead, new ways must be found to address current and future challenges of electronic information processing systems: physical size, speed, energy efficiency, new functionality, self-assembly/-organisation, adaptivity, resilience, cost. Currently, there still is room for improvement in CMOS technology and industry roadmaps reach out to 2022. The past decade has seen significant advances in new materials, which have led to many promising discoveries. While material research needs to continue, some discoveries have now reached a point that warrants exploring device fabrication, circuits and information processing systems for potential applications. As CMOS scaling is projected to end soon after 2020, industry will stop being preoccupied with advancing CMOS and will eagerly look out for new ideas. Given these two developments, we believe that university-based research now has a unique opportunity to integrate discoveries on new materials and technological innovations with the potential for advancing electronic information processing beyond 2020. Specifically, it is the vision of the Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (cfAED) that future CMOS technology will be complemented with new technologies (augmented CMOS), resulting in heterogeneous architectures to form highly efficient information processing environments.

       " 'The treatment of patients with chronic brain diseases is based largely on systemically administered drugs. However, sufficiently high drug levels in the brain are often associated with side effects for other organs of the body. Neuroimplants, which allow localized and individualized therapy, are an alternative but must meet specific requirements: they must be compact, biocompatible, resilient, and highly flexible, especially when applied to children and adolescents. Defined, nanoscale, therapeutically active coatings as well as the suitability of implants for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostics can open up novel therapeutic perspectives. To achieve this goal, microstructured, thin-film-based functional materials for the innovative local treatment of epilepsy, brain tumors and blood vessel diseases will be investigated. The material-controlled drug release and the interactions of the implants with cells are first explored in cell cultures. Then, the effect of the implants on specific structures and functions of the brain in disease-relevant animal models will be demonstrated histologically and in vivo by MRI and functional tests (e.g., behavioral observation, electroencephalography). The development of such future-oriented localized therapies and corresponding functional materials requires a close networking of materials science and medicine. Within the scope of the study program, the binding and comprehensible interdisciplinary communication of the objectives, methods and results are opposed to the future the members of the other discipline. It is foreseeable that there will be a significant increase in the demand for specifically trained scientists in the interdisciplinary field between medicine and materials science in Germany as well as internationally in order to competitively conduct medical-material-scientific research and development tasks. It is precisely this need for specifically trained scientists that is addressed by the Research Training Group applied for here.',\n",
       " 'The proposed RTG aims to improve understanding of fracture in brittle heterogeneous materials by developing simulation methods able to capture the multiscale nature of failure. With i) its rooting in different scientific disciplines, ii) its focus on the influence of heterogeneities on fracture at different length and time scales as well as iii) its integration of highly specialised approaches into a “holistic” concept, the RTG addresses a truly challenging cross-sectional topic in mechanics of materials. Although various simulation approaches describing fracture exist for particular types of materials and specific time and length scales, an integrated and overarching approach that is able to capture fracture processes in different – and in particular heterogeneous – materials at various length and time resolutions is still lacking. Thus, we propose an RTG consisting of interdisciplinary experts from mechanics, materials science, mathematics, chemistry, and physics that will develop the necessary methodology to investigate the mechanisms underlying brittle fracture and how they are influenced by heterogeneities in various materials. The insights obtained together with the methodological framework will allow tailoring and optimising materials against fracture. The RTG will cover a representative spectrum of brittle materials and their composites, together with granular and porous materials. We will study these at length and time scales relevant to science and engineering, ranging from sub-atomic via atomic and molecular over mesoscale to macroscopic dimensions. Our modelling approaches and simulation tools are based on concepts from quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, mesoscopic approaches, and continuum mechanics. These will be integrated into an overall framework which will represent an important step towards a virtual laboratory eventually complementing and minimising extensive and expensive experimental testing of materials and components. Within the RTG, young researchers under the supervision of experienced PAs will perform cutting-edge research on challenging scientific aspects of fracture. The RTG will foster synergies in research and advanced education and is intended to become a key element in FAU‘s interdisciplinary research areas “New Materials and Processes” and “Modelling–Simulation–Optimisation”.

Therefore, a metrology-capable atomic force microscope should be procured, the two o. G. Meets requirements. Unfortunately, a metrology-capable atomic force microscope is not available at TU Chemnitz. (There is a plan by Prof. Magerle (Chemical Physics) to procure an instrument with similar specifications, but this instrument will be fully used for very time-consuming tomographic measurements and will not be available to the extent we need). In addition to physical chemistry, the colleagues of the chemical institute (polymer chemistry, electrochemistry, technical chemistry) also need measuring time on the force microscope. Of particular importance is that both in technical chemistry and in electrochemistry there is a need to couple the force microscope to existing equipment for in situ investigations, or that the samples to be examined by the polymer chemistry (xerogels) are extremely fragile and to change during a transport across the street. This problem is a statement of the force microscope in close proximity to the laboratories of o. G. Colleagues or a daily transfer to the respective laboratories.

       " 'Modern software has to cope with ever-changing contexts that are caused by complementing new functionalities or by error correction, by support of new technical platforms, or by changing business rules. This complex problem is the outset of the research of RoSI. Members of this research training group investigate the implementation of roles as a universal and consistent concept for solving this problem. The concept of role-modeling has been introduced at different times and in different fields in order to model context-sensitive information or rather specified changes between contexts. The research training group RoSI focuses on this cluster of problems from the very specific perspective of a continuous application of the concept of roles for changing or rather context-sensitive software. Up to now, roles have usually been used in an isolated way for context-modeling in programming languages, in database-modeling, or to specify access control mechanisms. Never have they been used consistently over all levels of abstraction within the software development process, i.e. during concept-, language-, application-, or software-system-modeling. This challenge is the core mission of the research training group RoSI. Providing evidence of consistent role-modeling and its practical feasibility was and is the major objective of this research training group. Consistency means here that roles are used for context-modeling on all levels of the modeling-process. This includes concept-modeling (in meta-languages), language-modeling, and modeling on the application and software system level. Another research task that is linked to this is a further scientific exploration of modeling the role-concept in order to be able to model changes of context on various levels of abstraction. In this respect, consistency also implies that identified role-concepts can be connected systematically to each other in order to enable model transformations and synchronizations. Such kind of consistency offers substantial advantages during system construction as changes of context on different levels of abstraction are linked to each other and will be developed and maintained synchronously. Thus, foundations for new and innovative software-architectures are laid that meet the requirements of future dynamic and heterogenous software systems. Scientific excellence is the aim of this program. At the same time the individual mentoring and qualification program is of great importance. Therefore, on the one hand the concept of advisor tandems and thesis advisory boards are introduced to provide perfect conditions of supervision. On the other hand motivating, extracurricular aspects are integrated: Seminars on „soft-skills“ complement the scientific qualification and an international program for visiting scientists opens up an international perspective.

In reference to the relationship users—network, public debates highlight the increasing transparency of users – in the sense of a surveillance society – while the network is deemed to become increasingly nontransparent, i.e. inscrutable. The proposed Research Training Group (RTG) plans major contributions to reversing this trend: it shall enable better privacy protection for users and better transparency, i.e. assessability of the network. Privacy protection shall be customizable to personal interests yet manageable by the lay person; privacy-opposing economic or societal interests shall be better reconciled. With regard to network transparency, the RTG will investigate what we call the trustworthiness assessment perspective: users shall be empowered to sufficiently understand the networked entities surrounding them; most importantly, they shall be able to assess, by sound measures, the expectable outcome and quality of a service or system usage considered – including potential risks. Coordinated research into the pair privacy protection – trustworthiness assessment suggests itself for two reasons: firstly, it corresponds to the increasingly ubiquitous pairing user–network; secondly, the expected research results shall have transparency-reducing and transparency-increasing effects, respectively. A conflict of objectives arises, at the latest, when users double as service providers in the net. For centuries, privacy and trust have been relevant subjects for society. Hence, an interdisciplinary approach is compelling.

As a result, agricultural land prices have steadily increased over the past decade in many parts of the world. This development has fueled public debates on whether land markets as an allocation device work efficiently and whether current legislation is in line with political objectives and societal needs. Despite existing research, the current state of knowledge on land-related topics remains fragmented and does not provide clear answers to this debate. The proposed research unit FORLand pursues two overall objectives. First, we aim to evaluate the outcome of land markets and verify whether they fulfill their societal functions or whether adapted policy interventions are needed. To this end, we take a comprehensive view of recent developments on agricultural land markets and their drivers. Our second objective is to evaluate existing and proposed policy instruments to inform discussion on the design of optimal regulation. This involves an empirical (ex-post) evaluation of existing regulations in conjunction with the development of theoretical (microeconomic) models. We focus on developed economies (including mature and transition countries) since in many developing and emerging countries land markets have not been completely established and face different challenges. The complexity of factors that determine the outcome of land markets calls for a multidisciplinary approach including (agricultural) economics, sociology, ethics, geography and statistics. Apart from direct outcomes such as prices and their spatial and regional patterns, we also consider indirect outcomes such as land use because they affect important societal concerns. To carve out the impact that land market regulation has on land market outcomes we have to control for external factors, particularly urban sprawl and the developments on financial markets. Moreover, the interplay with other policy instruments, particularly agricultural, energy and environmental policies, has to be taken into account. Complementary to the economic perspective, we discuss equality issues of land ownership from a sociological and ethical perspective and consider environmental outcomes of land market dynamics. The outcome of this project will be particularly beneficial for transition countries that currently face the task of establishing agricultural land markets. ',\n",

H. on the basis of measured variables, it is becoming increasingly important. With demarcated growing areas not only certain quality expectations of consumers are connected, but it also result in decision criteria, for example on subsidies. Since the quality of a wine is influenced by a large number of parameters, the relevant components must be determined as fully as possible analytically in order to determine its origin and included in chemometric evaluation methods according to their significance. Modern multi-element methods can quickly provide many analysis data, which are evaluated using multivariate data analysis methods, providing information about complex specific properties and circumstances. However, previous studies show that the analysis and evaluation of limited sample sizes is not sufficient to determine the origin of a wine worldwide. On the other hand, a broad application of powerful and rapid analytical methods capable of determining many and particularly discrete elements is far more promising for a very large number of wine samples with subsequent systematic evaluation of results using chemometric methods. Previous own work on the trace element analysis of wines from German growing areas using optical ICPS spectrometry has shown that a distinction of origin of the wines is possible when a variety of trace element levels ('trace element pattern') is evaluated by multivariate data analysis. However, the detection capability of ICP emission spectrometry is not sufficient to determine very high-discrete elements such as rare earths and other ultra-trace elements. Therefore, low-resolution ICP mass spectrometry with multivariate calibration should be used for a comprehensive characterization of the wines. After the development and validation of a suitable direct analysis method, a large number of wines of proven origin are to be characterized experimentally and classified and evaluated by analysis data of certain organic wine constituents with chemometric pattern recognition methods.

For example, to assess salts or to test their resistance and susceptibility to interference in the acquisition of mass spectra using MALDI. Within the project, it is planned to implement the new sampling techniques in a miniaturized and mostly automated MALDI-TOF MSSystem and to test them for field measurements.',\n",
       " \"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a non-invasive method for studying anatomy and metabolism in humans as well as in animal and plant models. The method is increasingly used to characterize transgenic organisms and to study animal models of human diseases. Due to the limited spatial and spectral resolution of NMR, many questions can only be investigated with other, invasive methods, which results in a high number of experimental animals. By exploiting dipolar effects, this project aims to open up new applications of NMR in the animal and plant model. With the development of new spectroscopic methods, the spectral resolution of NMR in inhomogeneous objects is to be increased. The application of new imaging methods should make it possible to obtain structural information from tissue with increased resolution. The strengths of the new methods will be used to non-invasively observe the metabolism in leaves of green plants and to detect the formation of plaques in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and BSE in vivo. This project will make it possible to non-invasively investigate issues in the life sciences that today can only be answered with invasive methods.\",\n",
       " 'In the proposed work, we plan to develop novel methods for high resolution NMR spectroscopy in inhomogeneous static and radio-frequency fields. High resolution NMR experiments require extremely homogeneous magnetic fields to obtain chemical shift and J coupling information of nuclei, as these interactions are orders of magnitude smaller than the main Zeeman coupling to the external field B0. Achieving such homogeneity is not trivial, especially over relatively large volumes. This usually comes at the cost both in price of NMR systems and in size demanded by NMR magnets. Such homogeneities are not achievable when dealing with spatially heterogeneous tissues or employing remote NMR arrangements. Here we propose to develop very general methods based on time varying 3D gradients and spatially non-selective radio-frequency pulses for learning the distribution of inhomogeneous magnetic fields and then correcting for the phase acquired by the spins due to these inhomogeneities. With this correction, the chemical shift information of the nuclei can be extracted and high resolution spectra can be obtained. These methods can potentially replace dedicated shim coils in inexpensive magnets for specialized applications of traditional NMR or imaging experiments. The proposed methods will also advance the methodology of mobile and ex-situ NMR with applications to materials science, chemical engineering and geosciences, and in process, product and quality control. As a second major component of the proposed work, we plan to develop novel pulse sequences based on methods of optimal control and Fourier synthesis which are robust to Larmor dispersion of spins and rf-inhomogeneities and are significantly shorter than conventional designs used for the same purpose. As NMR spectroscopy at high fields up to 21 Tesla is becoming routine, there are emerging applications that pose new pulse design challenges. These applications include design of broadband excitation or inversion pulses, band selective excitations, decoupling pulse sequences in situations when the bandwidth to be covered is comparable or much larger than the rf power available. A natural choice in these settings is the use of adiabatic pulse sequences which tend to be very long and are not desirable in the presence of large relaxation rates. This makes it desirable to develop pulse sequence designs that are significantly shorter than the conventional methods and offer comparable compensation performance. Here we propose methodologies for the study of such designs. The proposed work will also develop sensitivity enhanced experiments in protein NMR spectroscopy based on these new methods. ',\n",
       " 'Metals and metalloproteins play a key-role in metabolism and formation of metal-containing deposits in brain and liver. In various diseases, analysis of metals and metalloproteins is essential for understanding the underlying cellular and systemic mechanisms. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) combined with other imaging modalities is a novel option to study the regional and cellular distribution of metals and related biomolecules. Thereby, imaging is a necessary step, particularly in the brain because of its inhomogeneous regional organization. Based on our experience in elemental imaging using LA-ICP-MSI with a spatial resolution between 200 to ∼10 μm, we propose: 1) to further develop LMD-ICP-MSI to imaging of metals at higher spatial resolution (10 to 0.3 μm; cellular level); 2) to develop a method combining elemental imaging by LA/LMD-ICP-MSI with molecular imaging by MALDI-MSI; 3) to apply these techniques to the normal and diseased brain and liver; 4) to study metals and metalloproteins distributions in normal and pathological human tissue as well as in knockout animal models of neurodegenerative and hepatic disorders and those lacking defined (metallo)proteins; 5) to transfer these methods to analyses of other brain disorders, e.g. epilepsy, and to other organs. In summary, we will develop the existing BrainMet platform to high mass resolution and high spatial resolution MSI techniques enabling the analysis of metals and metalloproteins from the single cell to the systemic level.

       " 'Vitamin D comprises a group of secosteroid compounds, of which vitamin D2 and D3 are the most important bioactive variants. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone health but has also been linked to many other diseases such as cancer and chronic liver disease. To determine vitamin D status in humans, several automated clinical assays are available, which measure the most important vitamin D marker, 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Unfortunately, these assays often lack specificity and accuracy. As a result, LC-MS/MS techniques are preferred today because of their ability to distinguish between vitamin D variants, their improved sensitivity and selectivity. Development of LC-MS/MS assays for vitamin D requires significant expertise to overcome the various inherent limitations, however, and the potential for interferences. This proposal addresses some of these limitations and suggests improved techniques for measurement of vitamin D metabolites. The approach comprises two areas of technical advancements; (1) chemical labeling techniques for increased sensitivity and selectivity, and (2) combined differential ion mobility (DMS)/mass spectrometry for separating isobaric/isomeric species, thus reducing potential systematic errors. Even though it is not the primary aim of this project, we are hoping that measurement of vitamin D metabolic distributions of well-defined patient samples will give us preliminary evidence for correlations of metabolite fingerprints with disease phenotypes. The first theme addresses important limitations of vitamin D analysis; that is limited detection sensitivity and issues of quantification, which currently restrict analysis to the main vitamin D metabolite in most assays. This precludes more elaborate diagnostic applications using low abundant metabolites. We intend to develop a differential quantification technique using new isotope-coded tags for LC-MS/MS, enabling comparative measurement of longitudinal up- and down-regulation of vitamin D metabolite levels, e.g. over the course of a supplementation study or for comparing stages of disease. We are also suggesting a metal-coded tag incorporating a lanthanide-chelating moiety, which will permit analysis at much lower concentration levels than currently possible, using analysis by ICP-MS.The second theme addresses the limited selectivity of LC-MS/MS from interfering endogenous components. In this proposal, we suggest a gas-phase separation step using DMS prior to mass spectrometry. DMS can often separate isobars and isomers because differential mobilities are largely independent of mass-to-charge-ratios but rather depend on conformation, charge distribution etc. Here we propose the use of DMS-MS for removing isobaric species and elimination of co-eluting interferences during vitamin D analysis, to lower detection limits and avoid systematic errors. We also want to examine whether DMS-MS is suited for separation of the C-3 epimers, to distinguish contributions of these species. ',\n",
       " 'Multidimensional high resolution NMR spectroscopy is among the most important analytical methods in modern chemistry. Especially two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation experiments are an essential element for a reliable characterization of molecules and complex mixtures in solution. However, long measurement times of the corresponding experiments lead to severe limitations and prevent their use in many applications. Based on the concept of the ASAP- and ALSOFAST-HSQC, we aim in the proposed project to develop and optimize a series of very fast heteronuclear correlation experiments with different objectives. For this goal it is essential to understand the determining factors for resulting signal intensities, for which a number of models based on systematic variations of parameters will be developed and experimentally verified. The fast experiments will then be extended in two general ways: on the one hand, the ASAP- and ALSOFAST-concept, respectively, will be included in a number of well-established pulse sequences like the HSQC-TOCSY, pure shift HSQC, ADEQUATE, HSQC-DOSY, and HMBC; on the other hand, the ASAP-HSQC as the basic element of the experiments, will be further optimized with respect to robustness, sensitivity, and possibilities for decoupling. Especially these optimizations will also lead to improvements for many conventional experiments. Finally, the applicability of the fast experiments will be shown for various research areas. The use of corresponding sequences will be demonstrated in NMR service and metabolomics applications, quality control and flow-NMR as well as diffusion-NMR. ',\n",
       " 'Degradable transformation products are increasingly becoming the focus of environmental research. A toxicological and ecotoxicological evaluation of these substances and the methods e.g. the wastewater treatment, by which they are possibly formed is thus not purposefully possible because these transformation products are rarely commercially available. Purposeful synthesis is basically possible, but requires knowledge of the chemical structure. Isolation and synthesis are expensive, time-consuming and tedious and therefore scarcely possible in view of the many number of degradation-stable trans-formation products that are to be expected in the future according to the literature. The use of high-resolution mass spectrometry allows comparatively fast and reliable identification if further information, such as e.g. UV-vis detection, structure of the starting material and other knowledge are used. This is then accomplished by means of modern, computer-based methods, e.g. Structural property relationships quickly make at least an indicative assessment based on calculated physicochemical and (eco) toxic properties. This knowledge is then also available in the context of sustainable chemistry for the targeted design of substances, in order to reduce or avoid down-time-efficient transformation products in the future. In the research on the initial biofilm of tooth pellicles, new biomarkers can be developed with high-resolution mass spectrometry.',\n",
       " \"As part of my research since 1977 on the young-quartern climate and landscape history in southern Africa, interest has increasingly focused on the extremely arid Namib coastal desert. As this desert is conditioned by the oceanic circulation (Benguela stream) and the atmospheric circulation, hygric climate changes reflect changes in marine and atmospheric conditions. Previous research on cave sintering and on gypsum crystalline soils to the young quartern climate history of southwestern Africa leads to the well-founded assumption that the striking climatic fluctuations of the young quartern do not affect the central Namib. For many disciplines of palo-alpine research (marine geology, paleoceanography, climate model research) this finding is of far-reaching consequence. The central Namib has no terrestrial, palaeoclimatic interpretable sediments, with the exception of pallioclimatic unacceptable cataracts. In many valleys of the Namib Desert, Slack Water Deposits (SWD) are sedimented during extreme flood events, which have not yet been recognized as such. Namib's SWDs are considered to be evidence of lower precipitation in Southwest Africa's scientific literature and paleoclimate constructions, rather than evidence of increased rainfall in (east of the coastal Namib) catchments, as their own preliminary studies indicate. An in-depth study of the SWD should finally explain the genesis of these fluvial deposits and thus lead to a clear paleoclimatic statement. The research is part of the IGBP PAGES project.\",\n",

Glacial sediments and forms have been preserved over several kilometers of the valley in the Seebach valley, which have not yet been recorded in exact cartographic terms or timed. This applies to the entire Glazialformenschatz of the East Bavarian low mountain area. The aim of the study is the exact reconstruction of a Jungian-Pleistocene glacial landscape in the Bavarian Forest. The analysis begins with the large-scale capture of the relief using modern surveying methods. The exact measurement serves the Morphostratigraphie, the differentiation of the glacial accumulation forms among themselves (predominantly lateral and endmoränen as well as glaziolakustrine sediments) as well as the separation of the Glazigene sediments from the closely associated relief elements of periglacial genesis. The integration of classical sedimentological terrain methods, which mainly focuses on coarse sediments, allows the glacial and periglacial morphodynamics to be more accurately characterized. In conjunction with geochemical and mineralogical parameters, a lithostratigraphic classification of all sediment types is carried out. Pedological and palaepedological investigations in the field and in the laboratory, together with the sedimentological findings, confirm stability and activity phases of morphodynamics. They provide the pedostratigraphic findings. Palynological results allow a reconstruction of the vegetation conditions and the vegetation development since the high glacial, prove the Kliamwechsel on site and the associated changes in the morphodynamic system and are in combination with the C14 absolute data (AMS) essential building blocks of the Chronostratigraphie.',\n",

A high-technology sector such as the microelectronics industry is subject to strong global competition and innovation pressure in these adaptation processes. The companies react with in-house strategies and international cooperations, but also use synergy effects that arise in industrial clusters through manifold horizontal and vertical interdependencies. Along the production chain, typical transfer mechanisms emerge, which are characterized by feedback interactions and foster innovation. The knowledge-generating exchange processes between suppliers, producers and customers are of particular importance in this context. Personal relationships characterize the functional links between chain links. It is therefore assumed that knowledge transfer plays a key role in the emergence of new spatial-sectoral clusters.

       " 'Hydrogels are cross-linked polymer networks able to absorb or to release large amounts of water. The water uptake is associated with a considerable volume change. In doing so, special gels, the so-called stimuli-responsive hydrogels, show two remarkable properties: (a) Due to the volume phase transistion behavior, the strong volume change can be excited by a large spectrum of different physical (e.g. temperature, electrical voltage, magnetic field) and chemical factors (e.g. pH value). (b) This swelling process is reversible. These properties make hydrogels a promising candidate for being used in sensors and actuators and allow their integration into microsystems. Hence, hydrogel-based microsystems enable novel solutions in microsystem technology which are of high functional potential and cost-effective. Over the past years manifold research activities concerning stimuli-responsive hydrogels have been seen, in particular focused on the synthesis and the study of the physico-chemical properties (e.g. DFG Priority Research Program on Intelligent Hydrogels). Our Research Training Group (RTG) aims at other goals. We target at the scientific fundamentals for particular hydrogel materials and properties essentially required for their usage in sensors and actuators. To achieve this goal many shortcomings have to be solved which hinder or even avoid the ap-plication of hydrogels in technical applications yet. On the one hand, particular materials and manufacturing processes are required which make the hydrogels suitable for these purposes (relevant functionality; high sensitivity, selectivity and long-term stability; fast response time). Such materials and processes will be developed and studied numerically and experimentally. On the other hand, these materials and processes will be used for dedicated microsystems (e.g. long-term-stable pressure-compensated pH sensors, biochemical sensors, chemical logic devices, microfluidic synthesis processors etc.). In the first funding period a multitude of new insights and results could be achieved regarding both the fundamental principles as well as the application fields considered. However, the number of unsolved questions which have to be solved for the development of hydrogelbased microsystems, is still big. For that reason, it remains still our goal to continue to pursuit the already targeted direction of our research. With its aspects of microsystem technology, structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, and chemistry, the research program of our RTG is very versatile. Therefore, it requires scientists educated interdisciplinary within all of these many scientific fields. RTGs with their interdisciplinary research, qualification and mentoring concept seem to us to be still the optimal frame to achieve our goals. ',\n",

The stoichiometric compounds focused on the crystalline hydroxyapatite itself, crystalline a- and b-tricalcium phosphate, and crystalline tetracalcium phosphate, which could be obtained by various preparation routes. Deviating from the stoichiometry of the crystalline compounds, partly amorphous calcium phosphates could be prepared by reacting apatite with calcium hydrogen phosphate or calcium acetate and investigated by various methods. OH-deficient oxy-hydroxyapatites were obtained by careful thermal dehydration of highly crystalline hydroxyapatite. All of these reference substances were characterized in full by X-ray diffractometry, IR spectroscopy and above all by various 31P nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. These results provide a solid basis for the study of plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite samples.

At the same time, German technology leadership in selected areas of research is to be ensured. According to the current state of knowledge, in Germany there is a lack of a national strategy for the development of material and material sciences with a simultaneous coordination of the respective professional societies. Due to changes in the understanding of research in materials and materials science shows that just a coordinated future-oriented strategy formulation and implementation in Germany is necessary. This requires greater cooperation between researchers from different disciplines and increased networking. It is important to build bridges and promote interdisciplinary research groups in collaboration with industry. This requires coordinated support in the understanding of a \"one face to the customer\" through a common platform of all specialist societies in the field of materials science. A single point of contact and coordinator increases the possibility of networking between research and industry on the basis of a national trend roadmap to be developed for the field of material science and materials science. It becomes clear that application-oriented research and basic research can not be separated without overlapping, just as modern technology systems do not consist of one material or one material. Often, the creation of complete systems is made of different materials whose individual contribution is only apparent in the overall system and whose intelligent combination provides above-average added value. An insightful research and localization of high-yielding harvest fields includes the knowledge of white spots. These white spots on the research map should be identified by the regular production of a strategy paper in the form of a Roadmap for Materials and Materials Sciences. Not one material alone can be seen as a lever for innovation; Modern applications take place in a system in which different components perform services. Modern multifunctional materials or e.g. Coatings in high-performance ceramics require the knowledge of various disciplines of materials science and materials science in cooperation of materials scientists, system developers and process engineers.

       " 'By chemical vapor deposition from organometallic precursors and oxygen as carrier and reaction gas (MOCVD) ceramic layers were produced in the system Y2O3-AI2O3 with different stoichiometry using the flash evaporation. The layers have a pronounced lamellar structure. Test series with systematic variation of selected coating parameters show a high complexity of layer growth. Particularly homogeneous lamellae have been observed, for example, in layers having a composition close to the YAG stoichiometry (yttrium-aluminum garnet Y3Al5O12), at a low coating temperature (900 C) or a high precursor feed. Closer examination of the lamellar texture of selected layers by high-resolution EDX analysis revealed periodic oscillations of the chemical composition with a variation of up to 10 mol% and a period length of about 250 nm. This observation may possibly be explained by concentration variations of the reactants. which are caused by slightly different evaporation rates of the precursors. A central role in lamellar growth could also be attributed to the limited available oxygen at the interface between substrate and gas phase. Due to the different oxidation behavior of the organometallic precursors, a temporary oxygen deficit would lead to selective oxidation and subsequently to phase separation. Microstructural considerations show that the coarse-grained lamellae with a thickness of approx. 250 nm can still be divided into many smaller lamellae. Here are probably complex, mutually influencing effects such as variable absorption and metastable phase relationships dominate. In addition to the lamellar microstructure, the formation of various mesostructures (dense, porous, columnar) was observed, which seems to have an influence on the tendency of a layer to delaminate due to different levels of residual stress. According to initial findings, the formation of the mesostructure is significantly influenced by the flow of the substrate surface or the substrate geometry. Similar to the binary system Y2O3-AI2O3, first layers were prepared in the ternary system Y2O3-Al2O3-ZrO2. These show a very pronounced lamellar layer growth, which is characterized by an antiphase oscillation of the content of Al2O3 and ZrO2 at almost constant Y2O3 content. This can easily be explained by the lack of mixed-crystal formation between Al2O3 and ZrO2 as well as the simultaneous formation of mixed crystals both between Y2O3 and ZrO2 and between Y2O3 and Al2O3. The layers of the ternary system appear in terms of their morphology and their thermal and chemical properties as very interesting high-temperature protective layers.',\n",

When we look at the Sun and the elements on Earth, we see the combined results of the production of elements in stars. Starting from the lightest element Hydrogen, passing elements like Carbon and Iron, stars can produce all the elements up to Lead or even Uranium. All these elements are necessary for our life on earth. We aim at reproducing the abundances of the elements by nuclear reaction measurements in the laboratory and nucleosynthesis simulations on large computer farms.Most of the elements heavier then Iron are produced by neutron capture reactions. An atom consists of a nucleus with positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons. A nucleus can capture a neutron and thereby increase its mass. After one or more neutron captures the nucleus may become unstable, and a neutron will convert into a proton. With the additional proton, the atom belongs to the next heavier element.The slow neutron capture process takes place in massive stars which are more than eight times heavier than our Sun. The nuclei capture neutrons at a time scale of a few years. The heavy elements are formed over a period of ten thousands of years. The element Gallium is produced in this scenario. However, accurate data for the probability of neutron capture reactions that produce or destroy Gallium are not available. The project GAIN therefore aims at measuring the probabilities of neutron capture reactions on Gallium with two complementary methods. The data will be used to run nucleosynthesis simulations to quantify the amount of Gallium which different stars produce. Following the evolution of the Galaxy, where many generations of stars successively produced heavy elements, we will obtain accurate abundances and compare them to the observed abundances in our Solar System.

'Specific botanical characteristics' are colour, size, taste, habitat, geographical distribution, stress tolerances, and growing season length.'Specific agricultural characteristics' are the dates of sowing, harvesting, and threshing as well as the rate of sowing, the yield, and the seed/yield rate, the scale and mode of irrigation, as well as the system of crop rotation. 'Specific processing characteristics' mean whether the specific cereal species were processed for animal or human consumption, to which kind of food the cereals were processed, and how they were processed. The project's goals are: 1. The Sumerian and Akkadian textual evidence from Bronze Age Mesopotamia and Syria concerning the specific botanical, agricultural and processing characteristics of barley and wheat species is collected and classified against the background of paleobotanical and ethnographical research. Thus, the scientific community is supplied with comprehensive tables of characteristics of cereals according to the paleobotanical, ethnographical, and cuneiform evidence. 2. The Akkadian and Sumerian terms for barley (SHE and its compounds), glume wheat (ZÍZ and its compounds, as well as SIG15), and naked wheat species (KÌB and its compounds, as well as burrum) should be identified as precisely as possible. Therefore, we compare the textual evidence with the paleobotanical and ethnographical data concerning the specific botanical, agricultural and processing characteristics. 3. The collected information concerning specific characteristics allows conclusions about the ecological, agronomical, economic, and ecotrophological environment of ancient Mesopotamian agrarian societies. In this context, the data first has to be analysed and then critically compared with the current ethnographical models regarding the workflow in traditional field cropping and post-harvest activities, in order to elaborate the diatopic and diachronic differences and similarities. \",\n",
       " 'During the Iron Age, the prehistoric people made large changes in land use. Forests have been cleared to an unprecedented extent, arable land has been created on less fertile soils, and grassland farming has been introduced over large areas, especially in stream and river valleys. This new type of land use was not limited to the lowlands, but also the low mountain ranges were integrated into the Iron Age economic system. Based on archaeopalynological methods, the diachronic development and spatial distribution of land use and their impact on the vegetation of the time will be investigated in this research project. In addition to a systematic and goal-oriented recording and analysis of already developed vegetation history sources as well as relevant new investigations, two intensively populated areas in the late Hallstatt period will be compared: the Wetterau and the immediate surroundings of the Glauberg and the Hunsrück-Eifel area. The aim is the development of models for different land use against the background of settlement archeological results and the comparison with the results from the one in southern Germany and the neighboring regions.',\n",
       " 'The interaction between man, economy and the environment during the Bronze and Iron Ages represents one of the central research problems of archeology in the Near East. In verifying existing models of social and political development of these periods, the archaeologist relies on a clear picture of paleoenvironmental conditions. In this project, using various scientific methods (carpology, anthracology, isotope and dendroclimatology) to close some of the major research gaps and solves the basal issues of environmental and economic archeology of the Near East and the Near Eastern Archeology for the period of the Bronze Age and Iron Age. With emphasis on the climatic development in the Middle East during the Bronze Age with the evaluation of tree ring sequences of cedars on the vegetation development in the northern Levant (Kinet Höyük, part Atchana, Qatna and Emar) and Northern Mesopotamia (part Mozan) in the period from about 2800 to 600 BC on the basis of anthropological and karpologischer investigations as well as by statistical evaluation of wild plant data as environmental proxies on the plant production of this period and the associated effects on the population at that time by means of karpologischen and isotopic investigations new fundamental data are to be obtained and evaluated. The aim is also to contrast the numerous information sources from archeology and philology with the own scientific results from archaeobotany and dendroclimatology in order to shed light on the difficult problem of the connections between environmental conditions, cultural change, economic development and environmental change in their dependencies and thus to a comprehensive overall picture Bronze and Iron Age landscape development and economic history in the considered area to arrive.',\n",
       " 'Under particular found conditions (anaerobic, water saturated, e.g., in latrines, lakes, and bogs), organic objects (e.g., textiles, wood, leather) can last for centuries; they represent invaluable information carriers for archeology. Without conservation, these fragile objects would be irretrievably destroyed after their salvage. The success of the usual preservation method for wet finds (PEG impregnation with subsequent gentle freeze-drying) can still not be satisfactorily predicted, because numerous parameters concerning the preservative on the one hand and the drying on the other hand are not clear. The inadequate conservation results in collections and depots illustrate a considerable need for research. The overall goal of this project is to optimize the method by varying relevant process parameters. On the basis of systematic investigations, materials for use in the preservation and freeze-drying of wet soil finds should be selected. In addition to the observation in the atmospheric scanning electron microscope, the method is to be simulated on original samples for the first time in the freeze-drying microscope and finally transferred to archaeological find material.',\n",
       " 'Ancient DNA research offers a great potential to gain insights into genetic relationships and population structure of extinct human populations. Despite a tremendous amount of genetic information that has recently become available from extinct humans such as Neandertals and Denisovans, very little is known about the genetic structure of Pleistocene modern humans that were contemporary with both extinct hominins, such as the European Cro-Magnon that colonized Europe about 35,000 years ago. However, population genetic data from Pleistocene modern humans plays a key role in understanding the complex picture emerging from the ancient human genetic data that involves gene flow between different Pleistocene hominins, genetic bottlenecks and extinctions. Using recently established DNA capture approaches in combination with high-throughput sequencing, we will generate in this project population genetic data from a large set of Pleistocene early modern humans from Europe and Western Asia. To establish the authenticity of the ancient modern human DNA, we will apply a recently published protocol that enables the verification of ancient DNA based on DNA damage and degradation patterns. This project will thus provide us with direct insights into the population history of Cro-Magnon and the settlement of Europe by modern humans that are not addressable with traditional archaeological approaches.

       " \"For more than 100 years research on the use and settlement of montane regions has been carried out. Here as well as in mid-range mountains scientific methods, especially pollen-analysis have been applied within the last 30 years. In many areas the old paradigm of a settlement of mid-range mountains in medieval times has been questioned or refuted.The Black-Forest too was seen for a long time as a landscape adverse to settlement and therefore a late developed region. New research carried out in the Northern and Middle Black-Forest has proved a land-use in the iron-age or at least in pre-monastery times. In this project the human impact on the landscape of the Southern Black-Forest and the strategies of resource-use since the Neolithic are to be investigated using combined methods of archaeology and natural sciences in three different landscapes (High Black-Forest, western Hotzenwald, eastern Dinkelberg). Systematic surveys, LIDAR-scan-analysis, sondage excavations and GIS-based analysis together with combined pollen and geochemical analyses in lake sediment archives can provide a consistent picture of the development and use of the Southern Black-Forest. Hints on deforestation, change of forests through anthropogenic use, agriculture, pastoral economy and anthropogenic fires are to be mentioned in this context.Thus, research in this project follows the recent years' studies in archaeology and natural science focusing on mid-range mountains. However, due to the fact that different physiographic subunits are compared and the high-montane region is included the proposed work goes far beyond that research. Taking into account e. g. sediment archives from lakes at different altitudes will enable to identify qualitative and quantitative gradients of land-use along an altitudinal gradient. \",\n",
       " 'The eastern and central Alpine copper economy played a major role in the metal supply of central Europe during the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. In that period, the Alpine economy changed considerably as mining and metal production transformed large parts of the landscape from agrarian and remote areas into early industrialized regions. Three of the most important copper producers have been selected for this joint research project: (1) the Schwaz/Brixlegg district in North Tyrol, Austria, (2) the Mitterberg district in Salzburg, Austria and (3) the Oberhalbstein district in Graubünden, Switzerland. In all of these mining districts Bronze Age to Early Iron Age relics of copper ore mining and/or metallurgy are widespread and the archaeological investigation of a considerable number of sites is highly advanced. The state of research represents an excellent base for a supra-regional study dealing with the dynamics of prehistoric large-scale metal production in the three key-areas and beyond. The fahlore mining district of Schwaz/Brixlegg played an important role during the Early Bronze Age, when fahlore-copper became an essential raw material for the central European copper respectively bronze market. From the late Early Bronze Age on and especially during the Middle Bronze Age, the Mitterberg district dominated the copper supply. An estimated 20,000 tons of copper were produced in this region, mainly from chalcopyrite ore (eastern Alpine copper). The Mitterberg area can be considered as a starting point for technological and economical innovations in copper production (Mitterberg-process) and the associated occupation of the eastern and central Alps by specialized communities. Fahlore mining and metallurgy in the Schwaz/Brixlegg district reached a second prime during the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. In the Oberhalbstein, chalcopyrite ores were exploited from the end of the Middle Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. Due to a different geological genesis, a geochemically distinguishable type of copper is to be expected compared with the eastern Alpine copper and the fahlore-copper. Whereas the systematic archaeological investigation of mining and smelting sites in the Oberhalbstein is just at the beginning, settlement archaeology furnished strong evidence of secondary copper metallurgy. Based on specialized (mining-)archaeological investigations, highly precise chronological data using dendrochronology, geochemical analyses and econometric evaluations, the joint project aims to carry out a comparative and diachronic study of these three important prehistoric copper mining districts. The aim is to reconstruct and to better understand the development and significance of the districts, their economic dynamics and the manifold interrelations within the network of alpine metal producers. The results will be integrated into the European context of Bronze Age and Early Iron Age metal economy. ',\n",
       " 'From the northeastern low mountain ranges in Bavaria, 100 Late Upper Paleolithic sites are known, which are distributed over an area that includes a large variability of landscape. The topographical features of the sites, combined with the exemplified analysis of a representative sample of lithic assemblages, enables the reconstruction of land use patterns by using geographical information systems and geostatistics. Main parameters used are the results of a point-to-point site catchment analysis as well as a predictive ecosystem modelling for each site. This innovative approach enables for the first time an evaluation of the carrying capacities on a large spatial scale independent from the presence or absence of archaeological sites. With regard to the variability of the landscape in the working area, it is expected that the modelling of the potential biogenic resources had a major influence on the site distribution. To elaborate this, the diversity of the formal tools as well as the raw material procurement will help to make assumption on site function and direction of residential moves. The combined analysis will be integrated in a synthetic model of Late Upper Paleolithic land use in the northeastern Bavarian low maintain range. ',\n",
       " 'The aim of the current research project is to obtain results on the characteristics and change of prehistoric agricultural systems and environmental conditions between the Mesolithic and Middle Ages in the Hessian low mountain region using the example of prehistoric settlements in the Lahn valley around Weimar (Lahn). For this purpose, an extensive data set comprising remains of about 71000 botanically classified cultivated and wild plants was compiled from archaeological findings.The ongoing evaluation of these data already provides results on agriculture and crop cultivation in the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Medieval settlement phases in the Lahn Valley. This section of the project will come to an end with the results of the Hallstatt and Latène periods. The investigation of changes in the use of cultivated plants and agricultural methods and the effects of increasing land use on the development of vegetation cover are objectives of the subsequent diachronic comparison. Regarding the question of whether the special location of the settlement area in the valley floor of Lahn and Allna determined or influenced the agriculture of the settlements, the investigation reaches its limits for methodological reasons. The prehistoric settlements in the Lahn Valley, just as large parts of the associated agricultural areas, were at the mercy of the changing river dynamics of the local watercourses. These may have had a significant direct or indirect influence on agriculture and livestock farming, as well as on settlement development. However, in the study area around Weimar (Lahn) these influences are still unexplored. Therefore, I intend to supplement and extend the results on agricultural development by geoarchaeological investigations. The geoscientific analysis of sediments and archaeological settlement strata is an important starting point for understanding natural influences on past economic and settlement areas, as well as anthropogenic environmental changes, and for better assessing their significance. The basis for the expansion of the scientific project is the unique collection of archaeological and scientific data which has been collected since the beginning of the archaeological excavations in 1991 by staff members of the State Archaeological Service of Hesse as well as by the applicant. The aim of the continuation proposal is to evaluate the existing findings regarding the geological structure of the valley and the river and flood dynamics and to link them to archaeobotanical results on the changes in prehistoric and early agricultural systems and environmental conditions.

       " 'The 3D structures of bio-molecular systems in atomic resolution, important for the in-detail under-standing of biological processes, are determined nowadays mainly with two experimental techniques: X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. But especially for the latter method there is still debate about the reliability of the obtained models since in some cases even totally wrong folds were pro-posed. As a new criterion for validation, we propose here to use quantum chemically calculated NMR chemical shifts. These chemical shifts are highly dependent on the structure and the deviation be-tween the experimental and theoretical values could identify wrong folds or even small problems in overall correct structures. We will use our expertise in fragment-based quantum chemical methods to make such calculations possible also for large protein and DNA/RNA structures and their complexes, whose sizes preclude the usage of standard methods. By combining appropriate levels of theory and basis sets but also taking solvent effects and conformational averaging into account, we hope to obtain the needed accuracy for bio-molecular structure evaluation combined with a computational efficiency for large-scale investigations. Finally, the resulting integrated software will be applied to specific targets of medicinal interest in cooperation with NMR spectroscopists and medicinal chemists. ',\n",
       " \"Viruses represent a global health risk. However, despite intensive, cross-disciplinary research, their attack mechanisms are often misunderstood. This is currently also true in the case of the dengue virus. Due to the complex course of the disease, it has not yet been possible to develop an effective vaccine. One reason for this is certainly that methods are lacking to efficiently obtain information on the size, morphology, or location of surface proteins (eg, in clustering) in vitro or in vivo. So far, such information is accessible only by sophisticated techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), in which the virus is in an artificial, inactive state. This leads to the fact that the determined properties can not be directly linked to the actual pathogenicity of the examined viruses. However, in the case of dengue virus, the number and surface arrangement of glycoproteins plays a crucial role in the level of infection. It is therefore imperative to develop methods that can detect these properties quickly and in a biologically relevant environment. In the context of this project, we therefore intend to develop an optical light microscopy-based method that allows us in vitro and in vivo, To establish a link between the structure and function of individual virus particles. Project i: For this purpose, we will (further) develop and apply the 'virus PAINT' (vPAINT) imaging process. vPAINT is based on superresolution fluorescence microscopy and allows the acquisition of optical images of viruses with a resolution of a few nanometers. The images provide direct information about the size and morphology of the virus as well as the distribution of surface proteins. In addition, they can be recorded dynamically and under 'live cell' compatible laboratory conditions. Thus, they do not require staining, freezing or sectioning of the sample and do not impose additional symmetry requirements. Project ii: This novel optical method will answer important questions on the relationship between the pathogenicity of the individual dengue viral particle and its stage of development. The distribution and number of membrane proteins (virus structure) of each virus should be correlated with their ability to fuse with the membrane (viral function).\",\n",
       " \"The dynamics of the particle-bound transport of pollutants is event-bound and can be divided into the variance within and between flood waves. The first point has already been examined in various works, the current DFG project should highlight differences and similarities between the events and thus enter new territory for research. For this purpose, old wave results concerning the scientific questions are worked up and supplemented with a large number of recent results. A flood event is understood as a complex reaction of the entire catchment to a precipitation pulse or a snowmelt. Included are aspects of the water level change (hydrograph), the concentration change of dissolved substances (chemograph), the transport of solids (quantity and quality) as well as the particle-bound mass transfer. This raises the following questions: What are the differences between the individual flood reactions? Are there typical 'wave groups' or are all outflow events unique? How does the particle-bound transport of pollutants depend on the different reactions in the catchments? What are the activation mechanisms of the supplying sources? these sources when and why?\",\n",

The latest computer and information systems are also used. The selected study area - the rapidly expanding city of Ramallah - contains various questions that challenge its exploration. So problems in the local water supply and in areas of environmental protection and pollution are currently unresolved. An extensive measurement campaign will be the basis for understanding the complex hydrological system and for sustainably calibrating hydrological models. In nested catchment areas of different scales, qualitative and quantitative parameters are determined. Finally, a GIS database is created that is equally accessible to all three parameters. Thus, it will be possible to calculate model scenarios for different urban developments. Those will provide information for the flood protection of downstream Israeli metropolitan areas, influence decisions on the future bilateral (Israeli-Palestinian) use of the Mountainaquifer, and enable a reasonable deal with local water resources. Mixed intensive cooperating trilateral working groups will carry out the research project. Two advanced training programs at the Universities of Freiburg and Jerusalem are being set up for the Palestinian partners. The efforts made in the field of science and education in the project will contribute to constructive and equitable solutions to problems that affect general environmental issues as well as current disputes between Palestinians and Israelis.',\n",
       " 'Biofilms play an important role in the transport of colloids through the subsurface, because they colonize the solid phase. Due to their adhesive properties, they are expected to affect the interaction of the colloids with the soil. This will be investigated with experimental columns with the material agreed in the preliminary remarks, an FTIR-ATR flow cell and model colloids. It compares a sterile with an unsterile system. The test organism used is a highly mucoid strain of Peseudomonas aeruginosa. Subsequently, an isogenic non-mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa is used to selectively recognize the influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The retention of the colloids is continuously monitored spectroscopically in the inlet and outlet of the columns. In addition, the column material is removed after given times and the biofilm is analyzed microbiologically and biochemically. The distribution of colloids within the biofilm is located by examination with the confocal laser scanning microscope. In the further course, the columns are inoculated with mixed inoculants of soil microorganisms, and the effect of drying and heavy rain events on the desorption of the colloids is simulated. The experiments are also carried out on a small scale in an FTIR-ATR flow cell, where non-destructive, on-line and in real time the effects of colloids on the chemical composition of the biofilm can be detected.',\n",
       " \"Resolving the effects of climatic processes on the dynamics of critical habitats (determined by their abiotic and biotic characteristics) is paramount to developing a capacity to predict the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and impacts upon the population dynamics of key species. In this program, the trophodynamic consequences of climate change (match mismatch) in the North Sea and Baltic Sea ecosystems will be examined using time-series analyses incorporated within four linked model approaches. (1) A three dimensional Eulerian circulation model, HAMSOM (Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model), (2) an embedded ecosystem model (ECOSMO), 3) a Lagrangian particle tracking population model for copepods and individual fish larvae (ECOSMO- IBM), and 4) a juvenile and adult fish bioenergetics model. Each of these approaches is based upon existing model frameworks that will be modified to better resolve shifts in the timing and magnitude of primary (five classes) and secondary production (stage-resolved) and how variations in lower trophic levels affects tertiary production. The target species at the tertiary level is a key pelagic fish species (sprat, Sprattus sprattus) important as a bottom-up control on the production of top predators as well as a top-down control, structuring lower trophic levels through grazing within these ecosystems. Small pelagic fish like sprat are one of the sensitive 'bio-indicators' of climate change on regional and basin scales due to their short life spans, high intrinsic growth rates (r), and tight coupling to meso-scale physical processes linked to climate (typical 'wasp-waste' response). Long-term data sets of phytoplankton (classes), zooplankton (species) and sprat (all life stages) within the Baltic and North Sea ecosystems will be used verify models, and simulate match-mismatch dynamics and consequences (scenario test) at a variety of temporal (months to decades) and spatial scales (meters to basin). \",\n",
       " 'In the proposed research project, the runoff formation and concentration will be analyzed and physically modeled taking into account different management measures in small, intensively sampled catchment areas (lower mesoscale up to 6.3 km2). Data sets from conventional, integrated (optimized conventional) and ecologically managed catchment areas are used. A key focus is on quantifying the hydrological interaction between the processes induced by different land-use and tillage practices as well as the impact of local measures of runoff reduction. Because the data available is spatially and temporally highly resolved and individual processes (such as soil sludge) have been measured, the modeled processes can be verified, calibrated and validated both separately and in their interactions. After identification of the flow-controlling mechanisms, scenarios are to be calculated which allow a quantifiable statement about the effectiveness of water-conserving forms of cultivation and land cover. This demonstrates the possibilities and limits of decentralized flood protection and compares the speculations in this area with a substantial analysis. Finally, for the validated model, test calculations are performed on a larger screen ruling in order to gain initial knowledge for a possible regionalization. To further validate the model, measurement data from current EU research projects can be consulted (WARELA project). If these test results are satisfactory, the extension and transfer of the processes and simulations to the upper mesoscale (100-1000 km2) can take place in a new project.']"
