       "['The hippocampal (HC) formation is a structure fundamentally important for episodic memory. However its exact functions have been underspecified due to the structural heterogeneity within the HC formation, posing technical difficulties for in vivo measurement in humans. Only recently advances in structural and functional high-resolution imaging have enabled research to document differential contributions of various hippocampal subfields to computational processes that are important for memory, including pattern separation and completion. In this context, pattern separation refers to computational operations that transform similar representations, for example derived from perception or memory, into highly dissimilar, non-overlapping representations. By contrast, pattern completion operations allow restoration of complete representations form partially available information. Initial evidence from age-comparative studies of healthy aged humans supports animal models of hippocampal aging, demonstrating that age-related reduced pattern separation processing contributes to declining acquisition of new information in aging. However, we have a weak grasp of the changes in HC structure and function during childhood, let alone the changes in HC subfields that underlie the development of pattern separation and pattern completion processes in developing children. In addition, it remains elusive in how far prefrontal control mechanisms can alter the relative propensity to engage in pattern separation/completion responses during adulthood. Accordingly, the present application proposes two sets of studies in order a) to chart the development of pattern separation and pattern completion mechanisms across hippocampal subfields, and b) to test the modifiability of those mechanisms by appropriate top-down control states during adulthood.

       " 'Stress plays a major role in the development and maintenance of major depression disorder (MDD). Indeed, various studies demonstrated maladaptive changes in physiological stress regulation systems of MDD patients, i.e. in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NA) system. On a central level, changes of the LC-NA system have been demonstrated. Several studies could show changes of the adrenoreceptor responsiveness (up-regulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors) in MDD patients. This seems to be the case especially in MDD patients with early life traumata. Comparable to the HPA axis, the LC-NA system influences not only the physiological stress response, but has also central influence with effects on cognitive functions. Indeed, NA effects on cognitive functions such as attention, learning and memory have been demonstrated in healthy individuals. In summary, NA seems to have enhancing effects on memory consolidation. Even though deficits in cognitive domains such as attention and memory are core symptoms of MDD, the relationship of the noradrenergic system and memory processes has rarely been investigated so far. Therefore, our research group investigated in a first study the influence of noradrenergic stimulation via administration of the alpha2-receptor blocker yohimbine on different memory functions. There,, we found an improvement of memory consolidation that was even more pronounced in MDD patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we found associations of yohimbine triggered consolidation improvements to early life traumata.In this project, we aim to investigate for the first time, if noradrenergic stimulation via administration of the alpha2-receptor blocker yohimbine has also more pronounced effects in MDD patients compared to healthy controls for a) learning and b) attention processes. Therefore, we will examine a) attention processes using an emotional variant of the Dot-Probe-task with a special focus on the depressive negativity bias and b) acquisition and extinction processes using a fear conditioning paradigm. Additionally, we will investigate the influence of early life traumata on these relationships. Thus, we plan to investigate MDD patients with and without early life traumata.For these reasons, we plan to investigate 40 MDD patients (20 with/ 20 without early life traumata) and 40 healthy controls (20 with/ 20 without early life traumata; matched for age, sex and educational status) in a double-blind, placebo controlled, repeated measures design.Results of this study will improve our understanding of cognitive deficits and the role of alpha2-adrenergic system in MDD patients, and thus support the development of new therapeutic strategies by considering these relations.

       " 'Background: The relevance and prevalence of suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation is contradicted by the limited empirical knowledge with regards to its acute risk factors and temporal dynamics. Gaining such knowledge is mandatory for the development of monitoring or intervention concepts (especially in high-risk populations such as psychiatric inpatients). The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS, Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010) offers a theoretical framework explaining the occurrence of suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. The IPTS postulates two constructs (perceived burdensomeness [PB], thwarted belongingness [TB]) that fluctuate within a short time frame and might serve as acute risk factors predicting suicidal ideation. While cross-sectional studies support the validity of the IPTS and its assumptions (Wachtel & Teismann, 2013), longitudinal studies analyzing the temporal dynamics of suicidal ideation and its association with PB and TB are lacking. Objectives: This is the first longitudinal prospective study investigating the temporal dynamics of suicidal ideation and its associations with PB and TB and other predictors under discussion (e.g. hopelessness). To address this question adequately, we use the experience sampling method (ESM) to ensure that the temporal dynamics of the variables under study are captured by the assessment strategy (i.e. within hours).  Methods: During 16 months, N=75 psychiatric and psychosomatic inpatients at the University Clinic of Leipzig will be recruited and diagnostically assessed (e.g. diagnostic interview, questionnaires) twice within a two-week interval (T0 and T1). The ESM phase (i.e. patients responding to questions regarding suicidal ideation and predictors of interest) containing 60 sampling points within 6 to 10 days takes place between T0 and T1 (technically realized by smartphone app, software movisensXS). During a three-month pilot phase, an adequate sampling strategy (frequency, interval) will be developed and ESM items will be validated with regards to their sensitivity to change. In several sequential multilevel multiple regressions, suicidal ideation will be modeled as dependent variable, whereas the predictors under study will be modeled as independent variables (concepts of the IPTS and competing variables assessed by ESM on level 1, trait-like variables [T0] on level 2). Relevance: This study is the first analyzing longitudinally the temporal dynamics of suicidal ideation and its association with the central constructs of the IPTS (PB, TB) applying ESM. We expect the results to significantly improve the prediction of suicidal ideation. Analyzing acute risk factors of suicidal behavior in clinical settings within a theoretical framework is mandatory before monitoring and intervention concepts (possibly in real-time) can be developed.

       " \"In addition to regular physical activity, smoking cessation and alcohol moderation, diet is among the most important influences on health and wellbeing. Despite strong advocates for particular forms of diets, there have been no in-depth, longitudinal studies characterizing the biological and psychological consequences of a change in diet. Furthermore, research on mediating mechanisms is sparse. Thorough studies of dietary influences on different bodily systems, including the metabolic system, the neuroendocrine system and the immune system, will hopefully shed light on the contribution of diet to better health. This study aims at investigating the effect of changing one's omnivorous diet to an ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet, which best complies with current recommendations of a varied whole food diet. Two groups will be examined: n=64 omnivores participating in a 2-month ovo-lacto-vegetarian dietary intervention and n=64 omnivores continuing their mixed diet. We will examine participants' glucose tolerance, acute neuroendocrine and inflammatory stress responses, basal neuroendocrine functioning, and subjective wellbeing prior to and after the intervention. Furthermore, we will examine participants throughout 4 weeks after the intervention to assess returning to previous dietary behaviour and possible rebound effects. We will also employ an ecologically valid (micro-) longitudinal approach to derive information on important confounders of dietary effects on health, such as other health-relevant behaviours or intervention-induced changes in mood and distress. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms will offer knowledge on why a vegetarian diet is assumed to be good for health, therefore also providing us with potential new treatment targets that will help in developing new approaches to improve health and prevent disease via diet. \",\n",
       " \"It is estimated that in the US, 17% of the population will be elderly in this century, and in 2010 more than 31 million people will live alone. Epidemiological and prospective studies identified social isolation as the main risk factor for scholarly disorders as well as increased morbidity and mortality; a factor that is comparable in its impact to traditional risk factors. The biological, behavioral, and psychological mechanisms that underlie the observed relationship between social isolation and health are poorly understood. Above all, the size of the social network was considered primarily and less the extent of subjectively experienced loneliness. The present project seeks to refine determinants of loneliness in order to elucidate the mechanisms of how loneliness 'gets under the skin'. This is particularly relevant for older age as the physical aging process of older adults continues to progress; i.e. the resilience decreases, so that overall a greater vulnerability sets. The planned study is a sub-project in a longitudinal five-year study of a representative sample of 230 older adults aged 50 to 64 years. Primary goals are, 1) Predictors and temporal stability of loneliness and four different mechanisms of%\",\n",
       " 'Social contract theory postulates that highly specialized cognitive modules exist to facilitate information processing in social exchange situations. In order to effectively protect the individual from fraudsters, the inference mechanisms that allow fraudsters to be discovered efficiently must be complemented by memory mechanisms that allow them to learn from previous negative experiences with scammers. In particular, it has been inferred from social contract theory that people should better recognize the faces of cheaters, or have better source memory for the fraudulent context in which a face has been learned. In recent studies, subjects interact directly with the stimulus people, which should allow for a more valid test of social contract theory predictions. However, data from these studies argue for a more flexible mechanism. Two studies showed that the memory for fraudulent and cooperative interaction partners was modulated by their relative frequency: The memory of the memory for the less frequent interaction partners was increased. This could be explained by the fact that information that is emotionally incongruent with a positive or negative expectation is particularly informative and therefore better remembered. In the research project outlined here, first of all, it is to be examined whether such an \"incongruity effect\" determines the old-new-recognition and the source-memory for cooperative and fraudulent interaction partners. For this purpose, a set of variables is manipulated, which are suitable for triggering a positive or negative expectation regarding the outcome of the social interaction. Second, it will be examined whether the incongruity effect generalizes to attention and early perception processes. Third, electrophysiological correlates of the incongruity effect will be investigated with the aim of a more precise theory test.',\n",
       " 'The proposed experiments will investigate the role of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system in attention processes. Methodologically, we want to achieve this through a combination of pharmacological and genetic imaging approaches. In three experiments, subjects are examined with a visual search paradigm, with requirements for bottom-up and top-down control being varied. Activity in the cholinergic system is experimentally manipulated by administration of nicotine at placebo. In addition, the effect of a polymorphism in the nicotinic receptor gene CHRNA 4 is investigated. These effects are to be recorded on a behavioral level through reaction times (study 1). At the neural level (study 2), fMRI is used to investigate whether the behavioral effects are accompanied by a modulation of the bottom-up driven ventral and / or the top-down controlled dorsal attention network. In a recent study, possible genotype-specific relevant brain areas should be temporarily disturbed by TMS and the effects of this perturbation recorded. In terms of content, the three experiments should contribute to understanding the neurochemical modulation of bottom-up and top-down processes of attention.',\n",
       " \"Episodic memory (EG) is based on structural and functional networks of brain areas that include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), medio-temporal areas (MTL), and parietal regions. These regions and their connections reorganize in the course of life. Little is known about the relationship between neural and behavioral developmental changes in the EC. The proposed project will investigate the neural mechanisms of EC education and their age-related differences by differentiating relative proportions of EC strategic and associative components. The strategic component relates to the selection, organization and elaboration of episodic features. In contrast, the associative component refers to binding mechanisms that integrate different EG features into a coherent representation. To investigate whether (a) the EC's restrictions on children stem mainly from the comparatively low involvement of the strategic component, which in turn is linked to the late maturing of the PFC; (b) Deficits in the initial level and plasticity of the EC in older adults reflect impairments in both components associated with age-related changes in PFC and MTL. The results of the project should lead to a better understanding of differences, similarities and dependencies between the components of the EC, which determine its development over the lifespan.\",\n",
       " 'Although cognitive behavioral therapy constitutes a prosperous possibility to treat anxiety disorders, relapses with a return of fear are often observed. Difficulties in the generalization of achieved successes to situations outside of the therapy context play an important role within this framework. Analogous to this return of fear, numerous animal and human experiments in the context of fear conditioning have shown that the use of a new, unfamiliar spatial context compared to the extinction context leads to an enhanced return of conditioned fear during extinction recall. This so-called renewal of conditioned fear is on the neuronal level particularly represented in hippocampus mediated processes. To the end that the return of fear should be reduced in clinical settings, the development of interventions that decrease context-dependent renewal carries great weight. Previous studies found that the use of multiple contexts during extinction learning provides a promising possibility. Further studies point to the importance of cortisol for the reduction of context-dependent (hippocampus mediated) learning. But to date, only little to nothing is known about the neuronal mechanisms underlying these interventions that modulate context-dependent extinction learning. The aim of this combined research project is to investigate the modulation of renewal processes by multiple contexts and cortisol on the electrodermal and the neuronal level. In two functional magnetic resonance tomography studies, the influence of the use of multiple contexts compared to only one extinction context (study 1) as well as the administration of cortisol (30mg hydrocortisone) compared to placebo (study 2) on the renewal of conditioned electrodermal and neuronal reactions during extinction recall will be explored. We hypothesize that multiple extinction contexts as well as cortisol will lead to a reduction of renewal in a new and unfamiliar context due to the modulation of hippocampus mediated neuronal processes. Besides, we are aiming at identifying potential factors (e.g. hippocampal volume) related to individual differences in renewal and the modulation of renewal. The results of these studies could make a major contribution to a better understanding of the neurobiological basis underlying the generalization of therapy success to new contexts. In the long run, a better knowledge of relevant influential factors and of underlying (neuronal) processes will contribute to the optimization of existing and the development of new interventions concerning the generalization of extinction.

       " 'Auditory perception is not a purely stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanism. In fact, memory schemata that represent individual experiences make it a subjective and constructive process. In particular, existing memory schemata directly contribute to the actual acoustic percept we get and also seem to enhance the chance of an auditory event to get into the focus of attention. This is obvious in complex auditory scenes when sounds such as a familiar piece of music or the ringing of the own phone are heard while other unfamiliar, yet acoustically similar sounds remain unnoticed. Although, these phenomena leave no doubt on the impact of individual memory schemata on auditory perception, we have relatively little empirical knowledge about the underlying mechanisms in the brain. Recent studies which mainly used electroencephalography (EEG) started to address this issue and identified different stages of processing associated with the perception of a personally significant, non-speech sound. However, only limited inferences on the characteristics of these stages of processing can be made so far, especially regarding their involuntary nature. The proposed project aims to study individual schema-driven auditory processing particularly in situations of limited processing capacity when visual or concurrent auditory input competes for processing resources. It will furthermore be explored whether previously found effects specifically indicate the processing of a personally significant sound or whether a more general, unspecific relevance detection mechanism is involved. Instead of EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG) shall be applied to characterize the different stages of processing not only on a temporal scale but also to identify the neural structures that account for schema-driven auditory perception.

       " 'Experiencing early stress experiences predisposes to the development of affective disorders and anxiety disorders. This relationship may be mediated by persistent changes in stressful neurobiological systems. In a pilot study, we observed an increased neuroendocrine reactivity to psychosocial stress in childhood-abused women with and without depression. The planned study will investigate the mechanisms of this increased stress response in (a) abused childhood women with depression (N = 25), (b) childhood abused women without depression (N = 25), and (c) healthy women without stress in childhood (N = 25). In particular, the participation of corticolimbic pathways and the central vasopressinergic system in the mediation of increased stress reactivity and the habituation of the stress response should be investigated. Furthermore, a counterregulation of the adrenal cortex and its physiological significance observed in the pilot study will be further explored. Results from this study can provide important clues to the etiology of stress-related disorders and help to develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders.',\n",

In the cognitive-behavioral model of eating disorders by Williamson, White, York-Crowe, and Stewart (2004), an attentional bias for negatively valenced areas of one`s own body and positively valenced areas of other bodies is assumed to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of body image disorders. To date, such a bias has only been found for women with eating disorders.

The application of pain leads to anxiety and avoidance behavior. An essential psychophysiological correlate in this context is the muscular tension, which can be regarded in terms of development history as preparation for the escape reaction. It plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of myogenic (muscular) pain. The underlying process is presumed to be in responding learning mechanisms: Pain and the accompanying muscular tension should be classically conditioned by coupling with primarily neutral stimuli.

       " 'The human voice has predominantly been studied as a carrier of speech. However, successful interpersonal communication not only relies on the correct decoding of the linguistic content of a message, but also on the ability to extract non-linguistic social signals from the voice. Among the most important non-linguistic vocal cues are speaker gender, age, emotional state, and identity. Current models of person perception (Barton & Corrow, 2016) assume a modular and hierarchical organization of voice processing pathways. However, due to the focus on voice recognition of familiar speakers these models fail to explain (i) how representations of familiar voices are acquired during learning, or (ii) how non-linguistic cues other than identity, e.g. speaker gender, are represented in memory. Moreover, there is a current lack of research into the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the processing of non-linguistic vocal signals under various conditions of selective attention.To address the question to which extent memory representations for speaker identity and gender depend on the attentive processing of voices, I propose two strands of research with two experiments each (E1 to E4). Building upon our seminal findings on electrophysiological correlates of voice learning (Zäske, Volberg, Kovacs, & Schweinberger, 2014) strand one will investigate behavioural and electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of learning and recognizing newly learned voices under selective attention in healthy participants. Specifically, we will study effects of incidental vs. intentional encoding (E1) and of visual task load (E2) during learning on subsequent voice memory. Strand two investigates effects of spatial selective attention on voice memory in patients with impaired focus of spatial attention: to this end we assess behavioural effects of perceptual adaptation on the processing of voice gender in patients with spatial hemineglect (E3) and monaural tinnitus (E4). Overall, the proposed paradigms aim at a broad spectrum of selective attention tasks in order to span various listening conditions of daily relevance. I expect that the present studies will significantly contribute to our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice memory as shaped by selective attention. Moreover, the patient studies may additionally contribute both to a better characterisation of two common clinical disorders and, prospectively, to the development of models and diagnostic tools for auditory attentional deficits in spatial hemineglect and tinnitus.

       " 'The perception of dyspnoea is an important part of the self-management of bronchial asthma, since a reduced perception ability is associated with delayed treatment and negative health consequences. So far, little is known about the cortical basis of this interoceptor process. Initial findings from imaging studies suggest, however, that the insula, especially the anterior area of \\u200b\\u200bthe insula, plays a key role in interoception of dyspnoea. This area is also significantly involved in the perception of pain, which has a number of similarities to dyspnoea. A comparison of both sensations has therefore been requested several times. The planned study will investigate the role of the insula in the perception of dyspnea and pain in persons with lesions in this area as well as in healthy persons. Short-term respiratory arrest by external filtering resistance should be induced and sensory and affective parts of the perception of respiratory distress should be recorded in order to investigate the specific influence of the insula or lack of insular activity on the two perception components sensory and affectivity. In addition, the perception of induced dyspnea should be compared with the perception of an induced cold pain stimulus in order to check whether a lesion of the insula causes a comparable diminished perception performance for dyspnoea and pain, d. H. whether this area is in fact the presumed general internal alarm center for interoceptive sensations of negative valence. The results are intended to contribute to an improved understanding of the neuropsychological basis of the perception of dyspnea, which is the basis for the development of therapeutic interventions in this symptom.',\n",

The extent to which genetic factors determine the individual HHNA regulation has only rarely been investigated. In the planned study, an innovative molecular genetic approach is to be chosen for psychobiology in order to explore a substantial part of this research question. It can be assumed that in a considerable proportion of individuals polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are present, which have a significant influence on the regulation of HHNA. A systematic phenotyping of HHNA regulation in groups with GR polymorphisms is not yet available and psychobiological studies are completely absent. The planned study will investigate the majority of currently known and relevant GR polymorphisms. The intention is to carry out a comprehensive characterization of HHNA activity in 220 subjects with corresponding polymorphisms. These include indicators of basal activity, pharmacological and psychosocial reactivity tests, assessment of glucocorticoid sensitivity, a memory test and psychometric procedures. The study will be carried out in close collaboration with a leading group in the field of GR polymorphism research (working group led by S. Lamberts). This biopsychological study is intended to clarify the question of whether genetic determinants of HHNA regulation represent a risk or protective factor for stress-related health disorders.

       " 'Envy is a social emotion, as it arises from a negative upward comparison with another person. Previous research has focused on interpersonal responses of the person who experiences envy. Consequently, interpersonal perceptions or behaviors of both interaction partners are largely unknown. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research that has investigated the relation between personality traits of both interaction partners and the experience of envy. Extending previous research on envy, an Interpersonal Model of Envy is proposed. The Interpersonal Model of Envy stresses the dynamic interplay between personality traits, interpersonal behavior and perceptions of both interaction partners in envy. The model claims that experiences of envy and its social outcomes can never be fully understood without analyzing the perspectives of both individuals: the social emotion of envy is not just experienced by a person, but also directed at and received by the interaction partner. The model proposes that personality traits of both interaction partners specifically influence the experience of envy in specific situations - a fact that has been largely ignored in previous research. Considering the mechanisms underlying this link, the model suggests that personality has an effect on experience through the appraisal of the situation or through observable behaviors. With respect to the social consequences of envy, the model also focuses on interpersonal reactions of both interaction partners and explains them by the (observable) expression of the emotion. Additionally, the model emphasizes that the proposed effects do not apply to all people in the same way, but are moderated by individual differences in emotion regulation strategies and in tendencies to comply with social norms. The objective of the current project is to test the Interpersonal Model of Envy by investigating interpersonal antecedents and consequences of envy in social interactions, focusing on mediating factors and moderators that can help to advance understanding of the interpersonal phenomenon of envy. The current project proposal extends previous research as follows: It 1) uses a dyadic design in real social interactions, 2) investigates the dynamic interplay between personality traits, interpersonal behavior and interpersonal perceptions of both interaction partners in envy, 3) assesses interpersonal behavior and emotion expression by using video-based behavioral observation, 4) uses an appropriate strategy of data analysis (i.e., actor-partner-interdependence-model analyses), and 5) integrates findings in a process model.

       " 'Earlier research has shown that young and older adults differ in the orientation of their personal goals. Young adults show a primary orientation toward growth, whereas orientations toward maintenance of functioning and loss-prevention become more salient in old age. This age-related shift is also represented in generalized expectations about age-group differences in goal orientations. Moreover, orientation toward loss-prevention seems to be maladaptive in young age, whereas maintenance orientation becomes beneficial in old age. This project aims at investigating correlates and mechanisms of age-group differences in motivational orientation and exploring the relations between motivation, emotions, and neural processes in approach-avoidance orientations. Specifically, it examines the neural correlates of age-related differences in approach and avoidance on the level of goals (personal goal orientation) and identifies the mechanisms of generalized expectations about motivational orientation. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of human ontogeny in terms of an age-related shift in motivational orientation that refers to developmental change processes in brain and behavior.

Furthermore, it was shown that kinematics does not simply reflect the physical target properties but the representation of the intended goal (goal representation hypothesis). In the project, three resulting questions will be examined and corresponding experimental series will be carried out. In the first series of experiments, similarities and differences in the mechanisms of action control in physical goals and effects will be examined. In the second series of experiments, evidence for the goal representation hypothesis under conditions where the physical targets are identical in the experiment will be provided. The third series of experiments will investigate whether attention moderates the effects of target representation in movement execution.

       " 'Food choice and intake is a daily and throughout normal subject. However, for more and more people eating habits and the question of food choice are of increasing interest and in several cases even a problem. The prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last decades and it is even spoken of an obesity epidemic. Life style interventions to lose weight often fail on the long run, also because people fall back into former unhealthy eating habits. Various factors influence our daily food choice, not all of which are apparent to ourselves. Thus, food choice might be goal-directed and therefore conscious and reflective, yet in other circumstances the choice to eat something specific might be based on eating habits which are automatic processes and thus difficult to control. Since a change in eating-behavior and long-lasting weight loss is most problematic to achieve, the current proposal aims to investigate implicit and explicit priming paradigms for changing habit-based and goal-directed nutritional behavior. For this, three studies are proposed. In a first study, the concept of implicit priming and explicit mindset priming (health mindset vs. palatability mindset) shall be investigated combined with a well-established Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer task to test goal-directed and habit-based behavior. In a second longitudinal study, the impact of fundamental weight loss induced by bariatric surgery on goal-directed and habit-based eating behavior will be targeted. In the third study, underlying neuronal correlates of implicit priming and mindset priming on goal-directed and habit-based eating behavior will be investigated in a normal-weight and an obese group using functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements. Here, especially structural, functional, and effective connectivity will be analyzed. Based on previous studies, the main neuronal target for connectivity hypothesis are the ventral and dorsal striatum, which represent major areas of the reward network and are strongly associated with goal-directed and habit-based behavior, respectively.Overall, the proposal aims to explore the benefit of explicit and implicit priming on food choices in normal-weight and obese individuals with a specific emphasis on the neuronal bases.

       " 'Initial evidence suggests that whereas older adults react with less anger to anger evoking stimuli than young adults, age differences in emotional reactions to sadness evoking stimuli are nonsignificant or even reverse. This age-differential pattern may be due to the age-related relevance of anger and sadness. Sadness is elicited by an irreversible loss and associated with low situational control, the tendency to flexibly adjust to unattainable goals, and the motivation to search for social support. To experience anger, by contrast, it is necessary that other individuals intentionally ignore or block a persons goals. Thus, anger is associated with high situational control, the tendency to tenaciously pursue ones goals, and the motivation for social influence. These emotion-specific appraisals and action tendencies differ in salience across the adult life span. To this end, young adulthood has been described as a phase of growth, during which individuals pursue and try to accomplish many new goals. Therefore, the elicitor of anger, an intentionally blocked goal, and the associated appraisals and action tendencies (i.e., tenaciousness) should be particularly salient in young adulthood. By contrast, old age has been characterized as a phase of developmental decline. Thus, sadness, typically elicited by irreversible losses, and the associated appraisals and action tendencies (i.e., flexible goal adjustment) should be particularly salient among older adults. In two laboratory studies, which expose young and older adults to anger and sadness evoking stimuli, we will test these ideas. We will assess younger and older adults subjective, facial-expressive, and physiological reactions to anger and sadness evoking stimuli as well as their associated specific appraisals and action tendencies. We hypothesize that age differences will appear across the different emotion reaction systems, in that smaller anger reactions and greater sadness reactions should be observed among older as compared with younger adults. We further expect that these age differences in emotional reactions are associated with age differences in generalized control beliefs, control behaviors, and social goals. Finally, we predict that age differences in anger and sadness reactivity serve adaptive functions, in that high anger reactivity is associated with subjective well-being in young adults and high sadness reactivity is associated with subjective well-being in older adults. These predictions derive from the idea that the function of negative emotions is to reduce an imbalance between the individual and the environment, and that an individuals age determines the effectiveness of different strategies to accomplish this task.

       " 'Oxytocin (OXT) has extensive modulatory functions in the social interaction of mammals. Human studies show that OXT on the one hand reduces social anxiety and on the other hand fosters trust and social rapprochement. In a preliminary study, we were able to show in a preliminary study that OXT facilitates the development of emotional states based on facial expressions. In another study, we found suppressive effects of OXT on the amygdala independent of the valence of the emotional faces presented. In this respect, the effects of OXT z.T. mediated via limbic structures, whereby OXT may reduce the general arousal and thus foster social rapprochement. The effects of OXT on emotion recognition indicate a modulating effect in the area of \\u200b\\u200bempathy. However, the specific subfunctions and the underlying neural correlate are still largely unknown. In particular, the reported effects in emotion recognition could be mediated via the amygdala itself, but also via structures of the mirror neuron system (SNS), which are given a central role in current neurofunctional models of emotion recognition. Thus, at both behavioral level (e.g., mimicking emotions) and neuronal level (activity in SNS), examining the effects of OXT is of far-reaching importance. In several experiments, on the one hand, the effects of OXT on the perception and recognition of emotions in general are examined, and on the other hand, in particular on the reflection or imitation of mimic emotions. In each case, data are collected at the behavioral level as well as at the level of neuronal activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).',\n",
       " 'The externalizing spectrum is characterized by disinhibition/impulsivity, antisocial-aggressive behavior as well as substance use and misuse. The major aim of the proposed project is to investigate the thesis that interindividual differences in externalizing behavior are associated with neuronal, emotional, cognitive and psychoendocrine stress regulation. We also postulate that differences in the extent of externalizing behavior predict aggressive behavior rates after acute stress exposure and that externalizing behavior is related to differential neuronal activation patterns during aggression induction. Although externalizing is characterized by altered emotional reactivity, to date, there is a lack of data on psychological and psychobiological stress regulation. Externalizing is not a categorical but a continuous construct. Thus, externalizing behavior will be investigated across a wide range of normal variation in a homogenous and well-characterized sample of normal and healthy adults. This approach allows to minimize otherwise typical confounding factors like comorbidity (e.g., in psychiatric and forensic samples) or significant contextual conditions (e.g., incarceration). To evaluate if our findings in subjects from the general population can be generalized to clinical samples, we additionally examine a forensic sample of men characterized by an early-acquired and persistent pattern of antisocial-aggressive behavior. As biological outcome measures, we propose assessing endocrine parameters (cortisol, testosterone); as psychological variables, we plan measuring emotional and cognitive responses to acute stress exposition. We expect dissociations between endocrine stress responses on the one hand and emotional and cognitive stress responses on the other. Applying an experimental design (acute stress induction versus control condition) we also investigate behavioral effects in a standardized acute aggression-induction-paradigm. We expect a higher rate of aggressive behavior after aggression-induction in subjects with a higher degree of externalization (in particular in subjects with forensic background) as well as associations between indices of aggressive behavior and emotional and endocrine responses to stress. A further important aim of the present project is the investigation of neuronal activation patterns during acute stress as well as aggression induction during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We expect that the individual degree of externalization is associated with specific neuronal response patterns in, for example, the amygdala, cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex. ',\n",
       " 'Due to considerable negative consequences caused by paranoid symptoms and the as of yet insufficient therapeutic benefits, a better understanding of the formation of delusions is necessary. In line with vulnerability-stress-models, research available to date points towards a dysregulated stress reaction, such as an increased negative affect, increased autonomic arousal and an aberrant cortisol response. It is not yet clear, however, how exactly a maladaptive stress reaction leads to symptoms. To answer this question, the neurovisceral integration model (Thayer & Lane, 2000) provides an important basis. In this model, vagal heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of a flexible adaptation of the organism. Moreover, HRV is conceptualized as an index of the effectivity of cortical-peripheral feedback loops, thereby linked to the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and emotion regulation abilities. In healthy individuals, research showed diminished HRV to be predictive of a reduced physiological adaptivity, which was particularly evident in a reduced recovery after a stressor. For participants with psychotic disorders, several studies have shown a substantially reduced HRV when compared to healthy controls. Based on this, the present project will investigate the association between low HRV and the psychophysiological adaptivity in participants with paranoid delusions. It is expected that due to the emotion regulation deficits related to a reduced HRV, reestablishment of homeostasis after a stressor is impaired and perceptions of threat are maintained.In a sample of participants with paranoid delusions (current or past; n=50) who will be compared to healthy controls (n=50), we plan to investigate (1) whether an altered adaptivity in participants with paranoid delusions is evident in a reduced recovery from a stressor; (2) whether less efficient recovery is associated with an increased reactivity to a new stressor; and (3) which mechanisms may explain the dysfunctional recovery and stress sensitivity, respectively whether these mechanisms (i.e., predictivity of a diminished baseline HRV, mediating and moderating role of emotion regulation, increased negative affect) are associated with an increase in paranoia. To test these assumptions, the planned project involves two stressor phases (bilateral feet-cold-pressor task plus paced serial addition task), each followed by a recovery period. The first recovery period will last 60 minutes to allow for salivary cortisol recovery to baseline. Along with enhancing the understanding of mechanisms to delusion formation, the project shall contribute to a better understanding of how reduced HRV may predict psychophysiological adaptivity and symptom formation. Based on this knowledge, targeted effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., biofeedback, emotion regulation focused therapy) could be inferred. ',\n",
       " 'The theoretical debate in International Relations (IR) is currently experiencing a renewal of interest in the issue of emotions. A large number of researchers believe that emotions and emotionality have to be given more serious attention, and integrated more systematically into theories of IR and any associated empirical analyses. In this research project, we select ideas that have been put forward by specific scholars and apply them to a most likely case, namely Russia and its foreign policy vis-à-vis the West . We stipulate that many of the Russian foreign policy inconsistencies, which observers have detected in Russian-Western relations, are in fact a result of socio-emotional factors, particularly an expression of the ruling elite s need to have Russia s international status, role and value given respect, and their own self-concept as representatives of Russia recognized. Using this approach, the project understands Russian foreign policy not primarily or exclusively as a result of rational calculation (power maximization, result of power struggles between domestic groups) or social norms, but adds another dimension to the explanation which lies outside the conventional IR paradigms. Our assumptions rest on insights drawn from social psychology, identity theory, and more recent emotion research and suggest that needs for respect and status concerns in international relations have an emotional component, as they stem from emotional judgments about the appropriate treatment by the interaction partner. We hypothesize that with regard to Russia, this socio-emotional dimension comes to the fore whenever the self-concept and status definition of the ruling elites is challenged by the interaction partners.

       " 'Psychological factors such as pain-related fear, pain catastrophizing and hypervigilance could be identified as risk factors for postoperative pain. However, psychological risk factors may be compensated by resilience factors such as coping strategies, optimism, and pain inhibition resources. Until now, the interaction of these two types of factors has not yet been used to predict postoperative pain. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on the question of whether and, where appropriate, how postoperative pain in turn affects such risk and resilience factors and how these in turn alter the risk of chronicity or the secondary occurrence of postoperative pain. This change in the directions of prediction represents a new approach. The aim of the studies requested is to answer some of the questions just raised. Psychological risk and resilience factors are determined using questionnaires as well as with behavioral (Dot-Probe Task) and physiological (inhibition and summation test) markers. The pain outcome is assessed using a questionnaire battery (DGSS pain response questionnaire). Mutual effects are analyzed in two directions, namely i) the prediction of postoperative pain by psychological risk and resilience factors, and ii) the prediction of the further development of these factors by postoperative pain.',\n",
       " 'Early traumatic stress is associated with abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HHNA). This is reflected in increased reactivity to stress, decreased feedback sensitivity, and changes in glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. Early traumatized people are at an increased risk of developing metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. An underlying mechanism could be that early traumatized persons under stress try to regulate the activity of HHNA by increasing the intake of food. This hypothesis is supported by preclinical studies showing that dietary intake of chronically stressed animals leads to an inhibition of corticotropin-releasing hormone release and thus to an inhibition of HHNA activity. We therefore assume the following model: earlier traumatic Stress leads to changes in the HHNA. After acute stress, those affected try to regulate the further activity of HHNA by increasing food intake. In the medium term, this leads to a symptom cluster of obesity / insulin resistance / metabolic syndrome.To test these assumptions, we want to examine subjects with and without early trauma, taking into account the presence of depression. We expect an increased endocrine stress response to psychosocial stress in subjects with trauma (1), (2) altered sensitivity of GR, (3) increased stress after stress exposure, and (4) a less favorable cardiovascular risk profile compared to non-traumatized individuals , This study aims to investigate a previously neglected aspect of the consequences of early trauma. These results may lead to a better understanding of stress-related eating behavior and its consequences.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, psychological research has become increasingly interested in the attentional, affective and cognitive processes that enable human coordination and cooperation. A promising avenue in the pursuit of this endeavor is the investigation of basic mechanisms of social cognition in increasingly complex interactive settings and in populations with specific interpersonal deficits. One such basic effect is the reflexive tendency to follow the gaze of others. While research has greatly advanced our understanding of gaze following and its role in information processing and successful interaction, far less is known about the powerful cue of eye contact, or direct gaze. The present proposal aims at comprehensively studying the underlying mechanisms and the functional significance of eye contact. Three consecutive projects will investigate direct gaze processing in experimentally controlled settings of increasing interpersonal complexity and in participant samples with impaired social abilities. Project 1 assesses manual and gaze behavior in attention capture tasks to gain insight into the preconditions and temporal dynamics of the integration of information provided by direct gaze and other socially relevant cues (e.g. emotional expressions, signals of trustworthiness and dominance). In Project 2, the role of eye contact on empathy, cognitive perspective-taking and interpersonal decision-making (e.g. generosity) is probed in real-life based, strictly validated and experimentally controlled tasks of social understanding and interaction. In order to address the role of eye contact in both interaction partners, gaze behavior is tracked in the participant and experimentally manipulated in an interaction partner. Neuroimaging data complements data on performance and gaze behavior to gain further insight into the dynamic interplay of neural networks underlying social attention and interaction. Finally, Project 3 applies the simple and straightforward paradigms of Projects 1 and 2 in carefully selected and diagnosed adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and conduct disorder (CD), compared to control participants. Through the systematic investigation of differences in basic gaze processing and spontaneous gaze behavior and their role in social understanding and interaction deficits, this project can inform existing frameworks of SAD/CD as well as the development of targeted interventions. Insights gained from all three projects will further our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms and the functional significance of direct gaze in meaningful contexts of social understanding and interaction.

       " \"The project will investigate the relationship between sensory-perceptual and sensorimotor processes in humans. We will address the question as to whether the trigger of a motor response depends on the internal response exceeding a (perceptual) criterion or some unrelated threshold proper to the motor system. A further objective of the project is to provide a new paradigm that allows for the quantification of the impact of near-threshold stimuli on the motor system. We will use a metacontrast paradigm: two visual stimuli are presented in rapid succession with the first (masked) stimulus presented within the bright, highly visible annulus of the second (backward masking) stimulus. The masking stimulus hampers the perception of the masked stimulus. We measure both the observers` perceptual and motor behaviour elicited by the same stimulus on a 'trial-by-trial' basis. On any given trial the reaction time (RT) to the occurrence of any of the two (masked and masking) stimuli is recorded together with the oberservers` response on the presence/absence of the masked stimulus. RTs are analysed as a function of both the presence/absence of the masked stimulus and the observers internal state (stimulus reported or not). Preliminary data schow that masked stimuli affect RTs only if they have been consciously perceived, i.e., if their internal responses exceed the perceptual criterion. This result contradicts other experiments reported in the literature. One part of the proposed project tries to resolve this contradiction. We suppose that the relationship between sensory-perceptual and sensorimotor processes depends on the compatibility of stimulus information and motor response. For example, the same external event (a luminance increment in the periphery) may have a stronger effect on the motor system, if the motor response consists in a saccade instead of a finger flexion (i.e., a key press). \",\n",
       " \"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder particularly affecting female adolescents. One principal symptom is a disturbance in the way in which one’s own body is experienced. Such a body image disturbance is not only a symptom of AN; it is also a risk factor that predicts the onset of AN as well as relapse and long term outcome. However, it is still under debate what the exact nature of body image disturbance is, and if it is caused predominantly by sociocultural and psychological factors or if it mainly reflects a biological vulnerability. Sociocultural and psychological factors may strongly influence thoughts and emotions towards the body. Disturbances of this cognitive-affective body image, which might be mediated (predominantly) via top-down processes, are well established in AN. Furthermore, even with full insight into their own severe underweight, AN patients typically report perceiving their own body as 'too fat'. Disturbances of this perceptive body image might reflect a neurobiological vulnerability that possibly underlies or interacts with cognitive-affective components. Importantly, perceptive body image disturbances implicate a stronger influence of bottom-up processes. To date, the perceptive body image has been studied comparatively little in AN. AN patients clearly overestimate their own body size. Moreover, when viewing body pictures, AN patients show increased activity in emotion-related brain regions, related to the cognitive-affective body image, and reduced activity in visual and somatosensory regions, related to the perceptive body image. Consistent with a perceptive dysfunction, AN patients show also disturbances of basic visual and tactile perception. Overall though, results are inconsistent and prior studies mostly neglected the relative contribution of bottom-up and top-down processes. To fill this gap, we will investigate visual and tactile body perception in AN using parallel electro- and magnetoencephalography (EMEG). These temporally high-resolution methods differentiate between early bottom-up and late top-down processes, and beyond that, as combined EMEG source reconstructions provide good spatial resolution, differentiate between brain areas associated with these processes. The use of source reconstructions in underweight AN patients has specific methodical implications: The severe underweight may be accompanied by brain atrophy, which can have profound effects on the EMEG. Therefore, source reconstructions will be corrected using structural MRI scans and possible effects of brain atrophy will be compared longitudinally in the underweight and weight-recovered condition. The availability of MEG, EEG and MRI devices and our (the applicant’s and the project group’s) clinical and methodical expertise excellently position the planned project for success. Upon completing this research, we will have a better understanding of the perceptive dysfunctions that may underlie body image disturbances in AN. \",\n",

The previous data does not allow any statements as to whether and in what way facial mimicry can be modulated by such personality characteristics. On the one hand unconscious mimicry is characterized as dependent on the attitude towards the opposite, on the other hand its dependence on motivational processes such as current goals or an activated connecting motive is emphasized. Although the influence of habitual attitudes on facial mimicry has been studied, there is a lack of research on the modification of current induced attitudes and goals. This is of particular interest because facial mimicry plays a significant role in social interactions.

       " 'Learning processes make it possible to change innate reflexes and behavior patterns, but also allow an expansion of the existing behavioral repertoire by acquiring new reactions and reactions to new stimuli. The scientific analysis of basic learning principles has made a substantial contribution to the understanding of different behavioral phenomena in different areas of psychology. In clinical psychology, for example, model ideas on the development and maintenance of different disorders, as well as various therapeutic interventions, are closely linked to basic psychology of learning psychology. One of the milestones of this scientific exchange is undoubtedly the development of confrontational therapies on the basis of psychology studies on extinction. The term extinction refers to both a procedure (the presentation of a conditioned stimulus in the absence of an unconditioned stimulus with which it was previously paired) and a behavioral effect (the decline of a previously established conditioning reaction). However, at the behavioral level, extinction can be easily reset by a series of experimental manipulations that involve a reoccurrence of the previously extinged reaction. An example of this is the so-called \"Renewal\" effect. \"Renewal\" refers to the reoccurrence of the conditioned response with a change in the contextual stimuli that were present during the extinction. Our understanding of the \"renewal\" effect is very important not only from a learning theory perspective, but also from a practical (clinical) perspective, as \"renewal\" is seen as a potential source of relapses after confrontational intervention. With this project we want to investigate the rules and principles according to which attention processes are involved in the realization of a \"renewal\" effect. Our analysis of the behavioral \"renewal\" effect could also support the other projects within the research group in their search for the neuronal mechanisms of the renewal effect.',\n",
       " 'In economics, empirical studies of individual choices are mostly based on field data from samples of human population. Despite significant advances in the field of neuroeconomics, we still know very little about the neural basis of economic choice. Previous studies showed that economic theory accounts well for animal behaviors. These animal models serve as a means to probe elementary principles of microeconomics, as well as an indispensable complement to human research by allowing neurobiological manipulations to be employed. Thus, establishing cross-species research will enable us to fully understand the neural process underlying economic behaviors. To this end, I conducted a series of lesion experiments to explore the neural mechanisms of supply and demand in rat consumers. Rats were trained to trade effort (i.e. nose poking) for rewards: their demand for preferred reward decreased as its price (i.e. number of nose pokes required to get a reward) increased, which is expressed as price effect on demand elasticity. When the budget (i.e. total number of nose pokes available per session) was extended to compensate price increases, animals maintained their original consumption pattern, as shown by smaller price elasticities relative to conditions in which price increase was not compensated. This budget effect implies that rats evaluate effort costs not only by their nominal value (e.g. net effort required to obtain a reward), but also with respect to their purchasing power (e.g., how much reward can be purchased given its price and available budget). Interestingly, I have shown that budget effect on price elasticity was diminished when anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was damaged, suggesting this region is crucial for animals to integrate budget information into cost-benefit computations. To assess the comparative value of our task, I translated our animal paradigm to a human budget task, and showed that manipulations of effort and budget had similar effects on human consumer behavior. However, despite these findings, it is still unclear 1) how the budget effect on cost-dependent reward valuation is represented in rat ACC neurons, 2) whether behavioral/cognitive process underlying this budget effect is parallel across species. To address these issues, I propose to conduct tetrode recordings in the ACC of rats performing the effort-budget task. In the second experiment, I plan to refine our human task to develop a fully comparable paradigm that allows future comparisons between species, moving beyond the behavioral level. Results of the two experiments will provide new insights and empirical evidence to interpret effort-based cost-benefit decisions under budget constraint in rodents and humans, which are not captured in previous studies, and advance our understanding of the applicability of economic demand theory across species.

       " \"This project will analyse strategies engaged by the people of Mayotte, the Maorais, to deny their Comorian identity and express a French one. In 2011 the Comorian island of Mayotte became a French department. This was the culmination of a political process that began with accusations of political and economic domination by the other islands during the late colonial period, provoked in particular by the transfer of the seat of the colonial administration from Mayotte to Ngazidja in 1962, and followed by the refusal of Mayotte to join the Comorian state at independence in 1975. This latest transition appears to reward the islanders' longstanding rejection of a Comorian identity and their persistent claims to a French one.The social and historical evidence suggests that the majority of Maorais are descended from immigrants from the other islands yet, despite maintaining personal ties, they often exhibit deep hostility toward individuals from those islands and reject any commonality of identity. This project will look at how the category 'Maorais' is explicitly constructed not as a different sort of 'Comorian', but in opposition to 'Comorian', both through claims to French-ness, and, given the obvious difficulties inherent in such claims, through strategies such as an emphasis on the Malagasy or Creole character of Maorais society. It will analyse how memories, individual and collective, of belonging are constructed and narrated, and how memories of being 'foreign' are erased.As Maorais invoke claims to being French, they must confront profound social and cultural changes. French civil law is replacing customary and Islamic legal systems; customary systems of land tenure are being abolished; and Maorais are required to assume family names. This project will probe the contradictions inherent in, on the one hand, a denial of Comorian identity and, on the other, laments of the loss of customary practices. It will ask if resistance to social and cultural change can be reconciled with a rejection of the identity to which such resistance appeals. Data will be gathered through fieldwork on Mayotte, aimed at elucidating identity narratives and discourses in a variety of contexts from the urban to the rural, the elite to the subaltern. Informants will include metropolitan French on Mayotte who are increasingly complicit in constructing an exotic 'Other', particularly in the light of negative perceptions of 'Comorians', and particularly through a writing of identities, in a range of spheres. Fieldwork on neighbouring Ndzuani will provide perspectives on Maorais identity construction in a different context. The three perspectives on memory, narrative and practice will allow for a synthetic analysis of identity discourses in Mayotte. Outcomes will include contributions to the anthropology of identity and of memory; contributions to popular and informed debates over identity in Mayotte; and ethnographic contributions to Comorian studies. \",\n",

       " 'In the field of implicit learning research, it is a highly debated question how conscious awareness about a sequence arises in an implicit learning situation. Two classes of theories can be contrasted in the literature: According to the first class, explicit representations result from strengthening of implicit representations. Thus, this class presumes quantitative differences between implicit and explicit representations. On the contrary, the second class postulates qualitative differences between implicit and explicit knowledge. As an example, the Unexpected-Event Hypothesis (UEH; Haider & Frensch, 2005) belongs to this second class of theories. It presumes that implicit knowledge leads to behavioral changes which might violate the expectations. This violation then triggers explicit search processes which in turn lead to consciously accessible knowledge. The goal of the proposed experiments is to test these two classes of theories against each other.In the first series of experiments, we manipulate the strength of implicitly acquired knowledge by, for instance, the repetition rate of the sequence within a certain context. According to the first class of theories, this should increase consciously accessible sequence knowledge. However, should the UEH apply, we should be able to show that an additional violation of expectations is needed in order to increase conscious knowledge. The second series of experiments then focuses on response-effect learning (R-E learning) which might increase the probability of experiencing a violation of expectancies. For instance, the findings of Hoffmann and colleagues (2001) suggest that increasing attention to response effects increases the amount of explicit knowledge. Furthermore, Keele et al. (2003) suggest that R-E learning might differ from S-S and R-R learning in terms of the underlying representation. R-E learning is assumed to be based on inter-dimensional learning processes because reactions are associated with events in the distal environment. By contrast, S-S and R-R learning results from representations within one single dimension. Therefore, the goal of the second series of experiments is to manipulate the R-E contingencies in an implicit learning situation while S-S and R-R contingencies are kept constant. We presume that conscious knowledge about S-S- and R-R sequences should increase if ones own actions contingently lead to certain events in the distal environment. Overall, the planned experiments contribute to our understanding of consciousness and the mechanisms underlying the emergence of consciously accessible knowledge in an implicit learning situation.

       " 'Picture yourself trying to spot a friend in the crowd of runners at a marathon. You are able to ignore the cheering of the spectators while simultaneously focusing on the visual impressions of the runners. Intersensory attention describes our ability to attend to stimuli in a selected modality while ignoring input from other modalities. Thus far, studies on intersensory attention have mainly focused on the processing of actually presented stimuli. However, top-down orienting of intersensory attention can also bias the brain states prior to stimulus presentation. Functional neuroimaging studies suggested that intersensory attention can cause parallel and selective enhancements and suppressions of neural activity in different cortical areas. In addition, electrophysiological studies indicated that neural synchrony, as reflected in oscillatory activity, could be an important mechanism therein. To date, however, only a few studies have examined the role of neural oscillations for intersensory attention. Moreover, no study has investigated the functional significance of selected brain areas, such as primary sensory cortices, for intersensory attention.   We will address these issues in three experiments using electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). All three experiments are comprised of a cue-target paradigm, in which an auditory cue indicates to which sensory modality (visual or tactile) participants should direct their attention prior to the appearance of a visual-tactile target stimulus. We will use state-of-the-art source analysis methods to investigate effects on neural oscillations recorded via EEG when stimuli are presented with variable (Experiment 1) or fixed (Experiment 2) inter-stimulus intervals (ISI). Notably, an orienting of temporal attention is only useful in Experiment 2. Experiments 1 and 2 will reveal novel information about to which degree enhanced processing in the attended modality, and suppression of processing in the unattended modality, relate to intersensory attention and temporal orienting. In Experiment 3, we will apply single-pulse TMS to selected cortical areas, such as primary sensory cortices, to interrupt local cortical processing during the cue-target interval. We will use the paradigms of Experiments 1 and 2, which will allow us to draw conclusions about the functional significance of these regions for intersensory attention. Taken together, the proposed project will further our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying intersensory attention and their relationships to temporal orienting. ',\n",

       " \"This research compares two practices: (1) Parental academic conditional positive regard (PACPR) - trying to promote academic effort and success by providing more affection and esteem when children study and achieve, and (2) Parental academic autonomy support (PAAS) - trying to promote engagement and success by taking children's perspective, and providing rationales and choice. PACPR appears benign and is widely recommended because it involves affective rewards. Yet, recent studies suggest that it is associated with stressful motivational-affective functioning in offspring, whereas PAAS is associated with more optimal functioning. However, the cross-sectional nature of these correlational studies precludes causal interpretations. In addition, there is very little research on the effects of the above two strategies on offspring's affective functioning and relations with their family. In an attempt to start addressing the causality issue more directly, and to considerably expand the scope of offspring's outcomes examined, we will use three research strategies:(1) A longitudinal cross-cultural study: 480 German and Israeli adolescents will be followed from 8th to 9th grade. Parental practices, contingency of self-esteem, type of academic motivation and engagement, affective functioning, and relations with family will be assessed by multiple informants (child, mother, father, teachers, and sibling when relevant). One aspect of affective functioning will also be assessed by a performance test. Both variable-centered (SEM) and person-centered data-analytic approaches (Latent Profile Analyses) will be used.(2) An observational study: A subsample of N = 70 mother-child-dyads (characterized by high PACPR/low PAAS or low PACPR/high PAAS, respectively) will be systematically selected from the longitudinal sample by means of latent profile analysis. The interaction between mother and child will be observed to assess behavioral outcomes of PACPR and PAAS.(3) Experiments: In three experiments, we will test the hypothesis that subliminal and supraliminal priming of young-adult offspring's representations of PACPR promotes offspring's stressful motivational-affective functioning and impairs cognitive performance under stressful conditions, whereas priming of PAAS representations promotes more optimal offspring's functioning. Findings of a Pilot-Study provide initial support for the hypothesis focusing on parental conditional regard.The proposed research will enable a fairly comprehensive examination of the differences between PACPR and PACCR as parenting practices, in terms of their effects on children's academic motivation engagement, and socio-emotional adjustment. Therefore, our research is likely to provide an acutely missing factual base which will inform the controversy regarding the desirability of PACPR as a parenting practice, and the extent to which PAAS is a superior parenting alternative to PACPR. \",\n",
       " 'The production of speech is one of the fastest and most complex motor achievements humans are capable of. Fluent articulation is linked to successful sensorimotor integration guided by predictions about the sensory consequences of actions. These predictions include information both about the expected sensory consequences of a speaker s own actions and the time at which various landmarks in the speech signal should occur. The temporal anticipation and precise motor timing are what we call predictive timing. To date predictive timing in speech is poorly understood. The present proposal addresses fundamental issues in how predictive timing is used to couple action and perception in speech. Our first aim is to investigate whether there is a common cognitive basis to predictive timing in speech and non-verbal behavior such as music, and the extent to which individuals vary in their predictive timing abilities across these domains. To this end, individual predictive timing profiles (i.e., event-based and duration-based timing mechanisms) in perception and production with verbal and non-verbal auditory stimuli will be established. These profiles will be related to the behavior of speakers when predictive timing in speech is disrupted. This is investigated by focusing on predictive timing deficits in stuttering and adaptive behavior to auditory feedback manipulation. With respect to stuttering, our second aim is to develop a unified model of predictive timing in speech production of typically fluent individuals and persons who stutter. Predictive timing abilities and potential deficits are examined in groups of stuttering children and adolescents, using tasks in which fluent speech is synchronized with a periodic external rhythm (i.e., paced speech). The third aim of the proposal is concerned with testing predictive timing in unpaced speech when temporal information in auditory feedback is perturbed: specifically on how adaptation to perturbed feedback is constrained by syllable structure in fluent and disfluent speakers. The proposal will open up new horizons for understanding the role of predictive timing in speech perception and production. Results will show whether predictive timing is deficient in stuttering and which timing mechanisms are involved. Furthermore, the proposal will shed light on the structures (i.e., on the syllabic level) at which predictive timing operates. The proposal provides the foundations for integrating models of the temporal control of speech as developed in the articulatory phonology framework with those that have focused on forward prediction and the role of feedback in speech production such as the DIVA model.

       " 'Intrusive re-experiencing of a traumatic event is a key symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Classical conditioning processes, which lead to the association of neutral stimuli with aversive consequences during the trauma, are assumed to contribute to the development of intrusive memories. Here, dysfunctional short- and long-term extinction of conditioned responses seems to be especially relevant. At the same time, contextual information concerning the traumatic event is poorly stored in autobiographical memory. Laboratory studies in PTSD furthermore indicate a deficient modulation of extinction by contextual information. This might explain the enhanced responses towards trauma associated cues in safe contexts. However, there are no studies investigating if context-dependent extinction processes predict the occurrence of intrusive re-experiencing. Additionally, there are only few insights about the influence of basic differences in the discrimination of contextual information and in cognitive emotion regulation on context-dependent extinction processes and the development of intrusions. As the investigation of these associations in clinical samples is only possible with sophisticated longitudinal designs, the trauma-film paradigm constitutes an ecologically valid and efficient alternative for the investigation of such research questions in healthy samples.Sixty-seven healthy females are to be investigated in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Before participating in a conditioning paradigm measuring context-dependent extinction processes and their neural basis, tasks for assessing behavioral pattern separation as well as the neural correlates of cognitive emotion regulation will be conducted. Afterwards, aversive film-clips will be presented to the participants during the trauma-film paradigm, and experimentally induced intrusive re-experiencing will be assessed during the following week. The main question of this study addresses the potential prediction of developing experimentally induced intrusions by context-dependent extinction processes and related activation of the fear and extinction circuit. Furthermore, the effect of behavioral pattern separation as well as immediate and prolonged effects of cognitive emotion regulation will be studied. The results of this study might contribute to a better understanding of relevant factors influencing the development of intrusive re-experiencing after traumatic events and its underlying mechanisms. In the long term, these findings might help to optimize preventive interventions as well as treatments for PTSD. ',\n",
       " 'In times of globalization, mass migration and increasing intercultural exchange, social understanding between cultures gains tremendously in importance. While former studies suggest superior processing of social information of the own culture, this so called intracultural advantage may result in impaired emotion recognition and reduced empathy for people of other cultures. This discrepancy in the processing of social information is reflected in neural response patterns as well as in overt behavior. Thus, to improve social understanding between cultures, there is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on the effect of culture on social cognition. Our project will assess the intracultural advantage with a new approach, namely culture neuroscience, under two major aspects: a) the systematical investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition in example countries of two different cultural systems: Individualism and collectivism; b) the impact of social learning on the individual’s original patterns of social cognition. For the planed project, we will recruit four groups à 30 participants with a cross-sectional design: 1) Germans living in Germany (individualistic culture), 2) Chinese living in China (collectivistic culture), 3) Germans living in China (social learning of collectivistic values), and 4) Chinese living in Germany (social learning of individualistic values). The comparison of these four groups allows not only identifying cultural differences in social cognition, but also investigating whether these can be reduced by social learning in people living abroad. We plan on applying three functional magnetic resonance imaging-tasks targeting different aspects of social cognition. First, we will conduct an imitation task to explore neural correlates of social-cognitive processing. Second, for investigating the neural bases of social-emotional processing, we plan to apply an empathy task. Third, we will use an empathy-for-embarrassment task to examine neural responses to advanced social-emotional processing. For exploring the cultural differences in intracultural advantage, we use facial stimuli from both German and Chinese people. In addition, questionnaires on cultural orientation, intelligence, personality, emotional processing and related psychiatric syndromes will be applied to all participants.To date, although growing evidence on cultural differences in social cognition has been reported, the neural bases of these differences are still not clear. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of social learning on cultural differences in social cognition. The results of this project will present a comprehensive picture of cultural differences in social cognition between individualism and collectivism, contributing to our understanding of intercultural variations, and laying the basis to optimize cross-cultural interaction and to boost social integration.

       " 'The construction of an explicit mechanistic model for information theory-oriented gaining insights into the cognitive processes involved in visual information processing provides the conceptual framework for the analysis and establishment of the underlying central nervous control mechanisms. The central theme of the project is the development and application of a neuro-information-theoretical model to study the role of top-down and bottom-up processes, which play a special role in visual object perception in the interaction between attention and memory. We use neurodynamics as a theoretical framework to integrate known experimental facts and hypotheses at the various neuroscience levels. Neurodynamic modeling allows a quantitative formalization of the processes for describing the dynamic behavior of individual neurons, neural networks and coupled network modules. We plan to explicitly model feed-forward (bottom-up) and feedback (top-down) interactions between posterior and anterior brain regions that are critically involved in processing and encoding as well as modulating and storing visual information. The essential components of this model are based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and the statistical theory of learning. The model will be developed on the basis of the concrete mathematical description of the brain mechanisms involved, and will allow a complete simulation and prediction of the effects of sub-median interference. These model features make it possible to predict specific disorders of information selection, attention and visual memory processes and their interactions in healthy volunteers and in patients with acquired focal brain injury. The simulation experiments will be empirically tested using experimental studies using delayed-matching-to-sample tasks.',\n",
       " 'The current extension grant deepens and extends the questions that were addressed in the approved grant, which was reviewed by the Fachkollegium Allgemeine, Biologische und Mathematische Psychologie. There, we behaviorally showed inasmuch auditory reafferences (AR) are relevant for action observation and execution. We would like to deepen these studies by clarifying the mechanisms underlying the recorded behavioral effects using fMRI, with a particular focus on the interaction between behavior and fMRI signal.Moreover, we seek to enlarge upon the previous experiments by a systematic comparison between two classes of movement. A novel and unexpected finding of the previous studies was that the investigated AR had a different effect on motor control as is found in language or music, i.e., auditory action goals: AR manipulation impaired motor control, but only temporarily. We suggest that AR that are part of the action goal (ARZ hereafter) are differently processed than AR that seem to be a mere byproduct of the action (ARN hereafter). So far, the latter sounds of action have been virtually neglected in research. Although we would not say that the sounds of our steps are part of our action goal when walking, their absence would clearly surprise us. One of the most influential contemporary action concepts suggests that we plan our actions by their anticipated sensory consequences. Are ARN, after all, part of our action goals just as ARZ? This view is challenged by findings of the previous grant where ARN yielded different behavioral effects than ARZ.The current extension grant addresses at the following questions: Are auditory reafferences that seem to be not part of the action goal in the proper sense relevant for action control? Are there principal or partial differences in the psychophysiological processing of ARN and ARZ? In the preceding project we observed, for the first time, compensatory processes, i.e. a trial-to-trial recovery of motor performance during interference by ARN manipulation. We would like to focus on the psychophysiological interactions underlying these findings. To this end, we plan to use interference by AR delay as well as AR deprivation. Our schedule comprises 3 experiments in which participants observe videos of their own actions while being provided with original (Exp. 1), delayed (Exp. 2) or no (Exp. 3) auditory soundtrack (ARN and ARZ). We record both behavioral and fMRI data. Graph theoretical analyses will enable us to consider the dynamics and quality of compensatory mechanisms in a novel way.The expected insight of the current proposal is in a theoretical extension of our concept of auditory reafferences: Do existing neurocognitive models of auditory action goals (language, music) generalize to other everyday action sounds? This issue has further implications for the scientific notion of action goal and for the relationship between conscious and unconscious parts of our action goals. ',\n",
       " 'Personality has long been thought to be stable. Only recently longitudinal research demonstrated that personality develops and changes over the lifespan and that people differ in their personality development. However, this research remains largely descriptive of the average and differential changes. Not much is known about why personality changes. In the proposed project, I aim to address this question by studying the role of the changing social contexts. Integrating approaches from lifespan theory and personality psychology, I plan to investigate how a major life transition, the transition from university to work, drives personality development in young adulthood, the life phase in which personality changes the most. Specifically, I aim to examine how this transition unfolds in daily life in order to get insights into the processes triggered by the contextual changes during the transition. This requires the use of high-resolution prospective longitudinal studies that combine long-term and frequent short-term assessments (i.e., intensive longitudinal data). I therefore plan to use such a intensive longitudinal data set that assessed a broad range of personality and contextual constructs both on a yearly- and a daily-basis across the transition to work. This data will allow me to address three major research questions that will guide my proposed research: 1) How does the transition to work affect normative personality development? 2) What are the individual differences in personality development during the transition to work? And 3) What are the mechanisms underlying the normative change and individual differences in change upon the transition to work, such as changes in personality states, social relationships, motives, and affect? With support from two leading experts on daily diary methods, I will apply multilevel modeling methods to analyze these questions. In sum, I believe that the results of this project have the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying (individual differences in) personality development during the transition from university to work. Hence, this project can help to provide new insights into why personality changes across the lifespan. ',\n",
       " 'Sleep problems as difficulties in falling to sleep or night awakenings are common in children and adolescents in Germany. It can be assumed that 10.7% of the adolescents suffer from insomnia. Those concerned have a high risk of chronification or exacerbation of insomnia symptoms. Additional, sleep problems have negative influence on cognitive development, emotional health as well as psychological well-being. Furthermore, perceived stress applies as factor for emergence and maintenance of insomnia. According to many studies with children and adolescents an association between stress, sleep and the stress hormone cortisol is evaluated. However, these studies neither implemented a detailed diagnostic of sleep disorders, nor considered the adolescents pubertal state of development. Moreover, data collecting was based on subjective information of the participants and the samples range of age was widespread. Aim of this experimental study is the analysis of the association between stress and sleep in adolescents (11-17 years of age) with or without insomnia. Concerning this the Trierer Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C) and ambulatory assessment methods will be implemented for the first time. Supplementary, within this longitudinal research (duration 12 months) with several measurements subjective instruments as questionnaires and objective methods as actigraphy and polysomnography as well as pupillography will be combined.

       " 'Vocal stereotypes of sexual orientations are well-known and, for example, perpetuated by representations in the media (e.g., gay nasal). Studies following producer-related approaches investigate the accuracy of vocal stereotypes by focusing on acoustic differences between speakers. They ask whether and how the voice characteristics of lesbian/gay and straight differ – more rarely referring to women than to men. Evidence of previous studies is inconclusive. Our own preliminary work indicates that context factors play an important role. Aim 1 of the present proposal is to illuminate the inconsistent evidence by including speech-based and situational context factors and relating them to speakers’ psychological features (e.g., speech-based context factors: text topics; situational context factors: interlocutors’ gender; psychological features: speakers’ self-ascribed masculinity/femininity). Studies following perceptive approaches investigate the content of vocal stereotypes by correlating listeners’ ratings of speakers’ sexual orientations with speakers’ voice characteristics. To elucidate the evidence that is inconsistent as well, Aim 2 is to use an experimental approach on the auditory perception of sexual orientation. Thereby, we introduce the novel approach of voice morphing to this research area and thus test which voice parameters contribute to sexual-orientation classification. For instance, selected acoustic parameters (e.g., fundamental frequency) of straight voices are transformed to those of lesbian/gay voices to different degrees while keeping all other acoustic parameters constant. Subsequently, sexual orientations of the morphs are assessed by a sample of listeners. By combining production-related and perceptive approaches, possible discrepancies between expression (speakers) and perception (listeners) of sexual orientation can be identified. Additionally, the auditory perception of sexual orientation is realistically conceptualized as a communicative act. Aim 3 of the present proposal is to conduct a meta-analysis, based on these and all published studies, and thus revise the Expression and Perception of Sexual Orientation Model that the first PI developed in his doctoral dissertation. The superordinate aim of the present proposal is to explain under which conditions stereotyped speech is used to mark sexual orientations and which voice parameters cause a certain sexual orientation impression. Thereby, fundamentals for evidence-based anti-discrimination work and logopedic-speech therapeutic interventions can be established. ',\n",
       " 'Animal studies have shown that stress affects the conditionability. The effect occurs both in cerebellar-mediated delay conditioning and in more complex hippocampal-mediated conditioning processes. Significant gender differences were observed: Male animals showed improved post-stress, whereas female animals showed a worsened acquisition. In the human domain, the influence of stress on declarative memory and retention has been investigated several times; However, associative learning studies comparable to conditioning in animal studies are lacking. The aim of the project is to investigate the influence of acute psychosocial stress on conditioning performance in humans. Three studies are to be carried out. In the first study, the effects of stress on delay conditioning depending on gender will be investigated. In the second study, the role of hippocampal stress in learning for the stress effect will be examined. The third study will investigate whether stress ¿analogously to declarative retention ¿adversely affects the recall of conditioned reactions. The project will allow to characterize for the first time the influence of stress on conditioning processes in humans. The aim is to gain insights into gender differences as well as possible endocrine and neuroanatomical foundations. These findings will be relevant for basic biopsychological research as well as for basic clinical research.',\n",
       " \"When we look around, the world does not appear to us as a random aggregation of isolated objects. Rather, the arrangement of objects in naturalistic scenes conforms to certain rules. The aim of this proposal is to gain further insight into how we use prior experience and expectations regarding object-scene relationships to efficiently guide our attention when viewing naturalistic scenes. We want to provide the grounds for a theoretical framework, according to which objects in scenes — similar to words within sentences — are processed in both a semantic (i.e., content related) and a syntactic (i.e., structure related) manner. By selectively violating expectations regarding a scene's semantic or syntactic composition, we will be able to investigate the effects of object-scene inconsistencies on attention allocation as well as their temporal dynamics by measuring behavioral performance, eye movements, and event-related potentials. A greater knowledge of what mechanisms are involved in the effective control of attention in real-world scenes will contribute to several core cognitive science disciplines such as cognitive psychology, visual neuroscience, or machine vision. \",\n",

The specific mechanisms undelying the association between stress and alcohol use are still not fully understood. Study aimsBased on recent theoretical models and empirical findings, the proposed experimental randomized controlled study aims at investigating the mediators and modertors of this association to identify targets for tailored preventive interventions. Since the literature suggests possible differences in the examined mechanisms depending on the current level of alcohol consuption, the proposed study will include both regular and risky drinkers.Short descriptionThe relationship between stress and alcohol consumption will be investigated within a randomized controlled experimental design to be able to identify causal mechanisms. For this purpose, 200 regular and 200 risky drinkers are randomized to an established stress induction paradigm (Trier Social Stress Test) and a control condition. Subsequently, various putative biological and psychological mediators will be assessed. In addition to self-reported distress, salivary cortisol concentrations and alpha amylase activity will be measured. Further, impulsivity (via delay discounting task), attentional bias (via dot probe task) and inhibitory control (via go-nogo task) will be assessed using behavioral tasks. In addition to these putative mediators, basal cortisol secretion (hair cortisol concentration) as well as self-reported childhood maltreatment, trait impulsivity and drinking motives as putative moderators will be assessed. Momentary alcohol consumption will be assessed as dependent variable using an ad-libitum taste test, a standardized covert measure of alcohol consumption in the laboratory. ',\n",
       " 'There is much evidence that actions are cognitively represented and controlled by codes of features of their perceptible effects, coupled with the accompanying motor patterns. Associations between the effects code and motor patterns appear to be acquired soon after birth, while action control functions appear later in ontogeny - in two larger steps around the seven months and around the age of six. The proposed project will investigate the interplay between processes of the seemingly largely automatic integration of motion-effect relationships on the one hand and slower developing control functions on the other hand. Four experiments are proposed to study (effect) stimulus-induced reaction tendencies under free-choice conditions in 5-vs. 9-month old infants and 4- vs. To examine 7-year-old children. It is believed that the perception of a motion effect evokes the previously associated response, or at least increases its likelihood of occurrence. Early development of motion-effect integration processes should produce such reaction tendencies in all subjects. However, due to the later developed executive control processes, age-related variations should adjust to the extent of these tendencies. It is to be expected that the pattern of effect-induced reaction tendencies and their age-related variations provides insights into whether and how action-control processes develop ontogenetically. This, in turn, may be an important implication for the theoretical understanding of the interaction of automatic processes and executive control.',\n",
       " 'Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with perceived defects in one’s own appearance. According to cognitive-behavioral models of BDD, BDD sufferers overfocus on single (often facial) aspects of their appearance while ignoring the entire appearance (or face; “the big picture”). They have self-defeating appearance beliefs and emotion recognition deficits, which lead to negative emotions and avoidance or rituals. While there is growing evidence supporting these models, research is still limited. The current results indicate that individuals with BDD, relative to healthy individuals, are more accurate in identifying subtle changes (particularly with respect to asymmetry and size) when being presented with a series of gradually morphed faces. This finding gives further rise to the question of building perceptual retraining into innovative cognitive-behavioral treatments for BDD. The current results also provide evidence that emotion recognition deficits can be normalized through a specific training, which is of potential relevance for the treatment of BDD. Further, individuals with BDD exhibit slower short-term and long-term extinction of de novo skin conductance conditioned responses to angry emotional expressions as conditioned stimuli. Whereas fear conditioning and extinction has been studied in anxiety disorders, to our knowledge, the current project is the first investigating these phenomena in BDD. Based on these promising results, the proposed project primarily aims at examining context modulation of memory of fear extinction in a 2-day conditioning paradigm (first aim). The second aim is to further investigate facial discrimination abilities including other people’s face as well as one’s own face. The third aim is to examine selective attention toward threatening faces. Individuals with social phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder will be included as clinical control groups. ',\n",
       " \"Asymetric behavior patterns exist in the caring of grandparents as well as uncles and aunts. So, for example, maternal relatives more than paternal. In sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, one interprets these asymmetries primarily with the hypothesis of paternal security. The greater reluctance in child care is therefore due to genetic kinship insecurity in the male line. However, the proximate causes of differential relational care are poorly understood. A two-generation study will investigate the influence of the parent-relative relationship on relatives' 3 child care. Another focus is the analysis of non-blood related relationships (step-grandparents and coed uncle and aunts). Parallel to the investigations in the Western world (Germany and the USA), comparative cultural analyzes are carried out with data from Java (Indonesia), Greece and Bashkortostan (Russia). Strong patrilateral family systems should be expected to differ. The results are intended to help review and, if necessary, expand theories on asymmetric relational care in cultural comparison. The investigation of the proximate mechanisms also provides a basis for understanding social family systems in humans.\",\n",
       " 'Obsessive-compulsive disorders are associated with hyperactivity in fronto-striatal brain structures, both under rest and under provocation conditions. In contrast to other anxiety disorders, pathological anxiety in the context of compulsive symptoms could only occasionally be associated with an activity of the amygdala, an essential structure for emotional reactions and conditioned anxiety. Its role in pathophysiological processes in OCD is still poorly understood. In addition, previous studies have significant methodological weaknesses. In two experiments it is shown that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder show hyperactivations of the amygdala when processing forcibly associated images, when the presentation of the provocation stimuli is short and the attention is directed to a competing task. Further, diagnostic subgroups of OCD are compared for their amygdala activity. In addition, the functional interaction of amygdala and frontal areas will be analyzed by means of methodically refined analysis of existing data, and neuronal mediators of increased peripheral physiological arousal during symptom provocation will be identified.',\n",

The model however cannot reproduce the market prices and one observes the well known implied correlation smile, see Figure 1. Many papers have been written on models explaining the empirical smile effect. More complex models explain this fact for fixed point in time but so far fail in correctly describing the time varying dependence structure. Given our joint experience with adaptively estimated time varying parameters and the expertise on modeling and pricing CDOs we can successfully transfer these technologies to time varying CDO risk analysis.Our aim is to study the dynamic behavior of the market implied correlation surface or equivalently the pricing surface in different valuation models in its time varying context. We will use for this aim modem statistical techniques (adaptive semi parametric estimation) and advanced pricing models and will create efficient algorithms for pricing and predicting CDO risks.The project is designed as a joint project between Berlin and Gießen since the expertise in mathematical modeling of derivative valuation and risk measurements in credit lies within the Mathematical Finance Group at the Universität Gießen and the statistical expertise for financial time series and time varying (high dimensional) dependency models is with C.A.S.E. - Centre for Applied Statistics and Economics and Institute of Statistics and Econometrics at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.

Using an ambulatory system in Study 1 gait patterns of 50 currently depressed individuals and 50 never depressed control participants will be recorded over a period of 12 hours. Relevant gait parameters (e.g., gait speed, posture) and more global motoric patterns (proportion of standing, lying, sitting and walking) of both groups will be compared. Moreover, participants¿ mood will be continuously recorded to enable longitudinal analysis of the associations between mood and motoric activity. In Study 2 participants (N = 132) will receive gait feedback to change their gait either in a more depressed or in a more happy gait pattern. In condition 1 feedback on posture will be given, in condition 2 feedback on dynamic gait parameters (e.g., vertical up- and down-movements of the body, arm swing; posture will not be changed). The aim of Study 2 is to investigate, whether changes in static posture or in dynamic gait parameters have stronger effects on the memory bias for negative material that is characteristic for depressed individuals.

       " 'The effect of professional teacher knowledge on teaching behavior as well as on the development of students has increasingly been investigated over the last years. Most of these studies used paper-pencil-tests to measure professional knowledge. Those tests are supposed to assess rather declarative knowledge, that is not able to explain observable teaching behavior sufficiently. For this reason, indicators of situated knowledge, such as abilities to perceive and analyze teaching in a professional way, are more and more focused in the last years. Those skills are conceptually based on professional vision (Sherin, 2007; Seidel & Stürmer, 2014) or research on teaching expertise (Blömeke, Busse, Kaiser, König & Suhl, 2016). Those situation-specific abilities are supposed to have a mediation function between knowledge (as disposition for successful behavior) and teaching behavior (Blömeke, Gustafsson & Shavelson, 2015). Currently, there are only few studies, mostly from the mathematical domain, that indicate correlations between professional vision and teaching performance or student learning (Kersting, Givvin, Thompson, Santagata & Stigler, 2012; König & Kramer, 2016; Roth, Garnier, Chen, Lemmens, Schwille & Wickler, 2011; Sherin & van Es, 2009). Studies investigating this relationship with respect to other domains and additional dimensions of instructional quality are needed to allow reliable and generalizable inferences. In addition, the hypothesis of a stronger correlation of teaching behavior with professional vision than with knowledge (assessed with a paper-pencil-test), as well as the hypothesis of professional vision mediating knowledge and teaching behavior, are presently not satisfactorily answered. The proposed study will address these research desiderata with respect to two relevant teaching dimensions, classroom management and learning support. A cross-sectional study with 60 primary teachers and their respective classes will investigate the relationships between professional knowledge and professional vision of classroom management and learning support (IV teacher) on the one hand, and the quality of classroom management and learning support (DV/IV teacher behavior), the students learning progress (DV students) and student ratings of classroom management or learning support (DV students) on the other hand. Furthermore, correlations between subject-specific constructs regarding learning support and generic constructs regarding classroom management will be explored. Beyond the theoretical insights into fundamental relationships between important aspects of professional teacher competences, the study will provide findings about the predictive validity of the used tests.

       " 'On the one hand, talent, talent and expertise represent individual resources and competences. On the other hand, societies on the collective level compete for the same characteristics. In addition to individuals with a broad field of skills (general human capital) due to their talent, there is a demand for individuals with very specific talents (specific human capital) that require years of high investment and difficulty in transferring to other fields of activity. These careers can be characterized as high-risk careers and represent the central research topic of the Research Training Group. Some of these career paths offer very high material gains and / or social recognition at the end, which justifies the long-term and high investments. Other career paths, on the other hand, lack high material recognition and no quick social recognition, but also require years of high-level investment. The research idea is to investigate, analyze and theoretically penetrate high-risk careers at the individual and collective level in the fields of sports, science, art and entrepreneurship with regard to talent and expertise research, educational economics and the underlying market structures.',\n",
       " 'Currently, there is an ongoing debate concerning the functional role of emotion in moral judgment and decision-making (JDM). Thus, emotions may either (a) play a causal role, (b) exert a moderating influence, or (c) merely reflect an epiphenomenal by-product of moral JDM. Even if one assumes that emotions play a critical role in JDM, so far the mechanisms underlying their influence on moral information processing have remained unclear. In the present project, we are specifically interested in the question of whether affective processes and states assumed to be involved in moral JDM do indeed precede the decision process, as assumed by two prominent theories of moral judgment (social-intuitivist model of Haidt and dual-process theory of Greene and colleagues). Hence, we aim at examining the time-course of moral processing in paradigms that give us access to the underlying mental processes and (affective) states in close temporal proximity to their elicitation. A further goal is to assess the impact of emotion-related dimensions (arousal, valence, motivational tendency) on moral JDM for different types of moral (or socio-normative) materials. To address these questions, we employ different vignettes and task paradigms, analysing psychophysiological measures (event-related potentials, electrodermal activity, facial muscle activity) in addition to behavioural ones (response time).

       " 'The mere cognitive processing of a potential threat may almost immediately accelerate cardiac activity. Although cortical and cardiac processes are known to affect each other and covary (cortico-cardiac covariation), we do not know why cortico-cardiac covariation is stronger in some individuals than in others. Individual differences in cortico-cardiac covariation relate to individual differences in anxiety and are thus particularly important for our understanding of dispositional anxiety and anxiety disorders. Here, two studies with healthy participants are proposed in an attempt to shed light on markers and mechanisms of cortico-cardiac covariation. The main goal of study 1 is to test whether previously reported within-subject correlations of time-lagged single-trial EEG and heart rate provide a stable and valid trait-marker for cortico-cardiac covariation with relevance for anxiety. N = 67 participants perform several paradigms (gambling task, time estimation task and fear conditioning paradigm) that evoke well-characterized signatures in EEG, heart rate and measures of EEG-heart rate covariation and dispositional anxiety is assessed. The same paradigms are performed 6 months later. With the collected data the re-test reliability, convergent, construct and predictive (i.e. anxiety) validity of cortico-cardiac covariation as assessed with various measures (EEG-heart rate covariation, stimulus-evoked heart rate responses, heart rate variability) and various paradigms will be assessed using multi-trait-multi-method and cross-lagged panel approaches. The main goal of study 2 is to investigate underlying mechanisms of cortico-cardiac covariation and to experimentally test whether individual differences in cortico-cardiac covariation contribute to individual differences in anxiety or vice versa. In that study, N = 148 participants perform a gambling task during threat-of-shock and control conditions. Importantly, we intend to pharmacologically alter cortico-cardiac covariation by double blind and placebo-controlled intake of escitalopram (10 mg), a substance that presumably affects cortical influences on the heart by modulating serotonin activity. By assessing whether (A) (pharmacologically induced) alterations of cortico-cardiac covariation mediate the subjective experience of anxiety during the anticipation of shocks or (B) whether (threat-of-shock induced) alterations of anxiety mediate changes in cortico-cardiac covariation, inferences about causal relationships between anxiety and cortico-cardiac covariation can be made. In combination, studies 1 and 2 thus inform, whether cortico-cardiac covariation as assessed with combined EEG-heart rate measurements reflects a stable trait and a risk factor for experiencing anxiety. Both studies will provide important insights into the general mechanisms by which the brain communicates with the heart and into the mechanisms of individual variation in cortico-cardiac covariation.

       " 'When deciding on the collective financing of new technologies in health care, every society must find ways to rationalize their value. In order to do so, robust methods must be developed to estimate what value society attaches to the health benefits it brings in terms of life extension and quality of life. If one measures the health benefit in \"quality-adjusted life years\" (QALYs), then one needs a monetary evaluation of a QALY by the society members. In the EuroVaQ (European Value of a QALY) research project, attempts were made in 10 European countries (excluding Germany) to determine the \"monetary value of a QALY\" through internet-based surveys. The average willingness to pay found is very low compared to the \"thresholds\" for the \"costs per additional QALY\" in the countries, which make the reimbursement of innovative processes dependent on the cost-benefit ratio.

       " 'The aesthetic perception of artworks is largely dependent on cultural norms and previous exposure to art objects (Leder, Belke, Oeberst, & Augustin, 2004). Nevertheless, it has been shown that certain properties of visual objects can be related to positive ratings on beauty in artworks. Therefore, one subfield within aesthetics research focuses on these formal aspects of the stimuli.Gustav Theodor Fechner is considered the founder of aesthetic science. He searched for objective properties that can be associated with perception of beauty (outer psychophysics, Fechner, 1876). He was one of the first scientists to directly measure objective properties of aesthetic stimuli. Along this line, recent studies focus on the investigation of statistical image properties that are considered to be relevant for human visual perception. For some years, Christoph Redies and I have applied digital analyses of statistical image properties. In several studies, we showed a relation of global image properties (spectral Fourier slope, anisotropy, self-similarity and complexity) with subjective ratings on beauty (e.g., Redies, Hasenstein, Denzler, 2007; Mallon, Redies, & Hayn-Leichsenring, 2014).In another approach, neuroscientists like Anjan Chatterjee have made highly interesting progress in connecting subjective beauty ratings with neurophysiological activities (inner psychophysics). It has been shown that aesthetic experiences are generally processed within brain areas that are usually associated with other tasks. On the one hand, depending on the type of aesthetic stimulus, domain-specific neuronal activities can be found in parts of the sensorimotor system, while on the other hand, the exposure to different beautiful stimuli leads to similar activation patterns within the emotion-valuation-system (Pegors, Kable, Chatterjee, & Epstein, 2014; Chatterjee & Vartanian, 2014).In the proposed project, Anjan Chatterjee and I are planning to investigate whether established global image properties correlate with neurophysiological activities. To this aim, we are planning three fMRI studies with different types of stimuli. We will relate the neuronal responses to landscape paintings, art portraits and abstract art paintings with their statitsical image properties. Special focus will be laid on specific areas of the sensorimotor system and the emotion-valuation-system. Therefore, the aim of the current proposal is to establish a link between outer and inner psychophysics. ',\n",
       " 'In our complex human environment the ability to selectively control urges and impulses is essential for targeted behavioral control. Disturbance specifically of selective response inhibition is assumed to be a central pathomechanism of different neuropsychiatric diseases. Selective response inhibition can be assessed with a selective stopping task. When performing such a selective stopping task in which participants have to inhibit a response upon occurrence of one critical signal (stop-signal) but not of another signal (attentional capture-signal), different strategies can be applied: Individuals may inhibit their response truly selectively only upon viewing a stop-signal (Independent Discriminate then Stop strategy, ID), whenever viewing a stop- or ac-signal (Stop then Discriminate Strategy, SD), or the discrimination- and go-process may interact (Dependent Discriminate then Stop strategy, DD). These strategies are associated with differences in reaction times and brain activation patterns. Yet, strategic differences could be driven by differences in latent cognitive functions such as speed of data processing (i.e. drift rate), speed-accuracy trade-off/ response caution (i.e. boundary separation), or a priori bias for a response alternative (i.e. bias in cognitive information processing). Latent cognitive functions and their neural underpinnings can only be assessed using a model-based cognitive neuroscientific approach combining experimental psychology, mathematical psychology and traditional neuroscience. Variation in such latent cognitive functions has the potential to best explain distinct brain activation patterns associated with distinct selective stopping strategies rather than a simple comparison of the strategies using traditional neuroscientific approaches. In order to bridge the gap between neural processes and overt behavior, state-of-the-art methods of model-based cognitive neuroscience will be applied on a data set of a study with 80 participants performing a selective stopping task during functional magnetic resonance imaging.

       " 'Selective attention improves the processing of stimuli. A number of recent studies have shown that this improvement also occurs when attention is focused on one point in time. Whether these temporal attention effects are conveyed via early, perceptual, or late, decision-making or reaction-related processing levels, for the visual modality, seems to depend on the nature of the attention directed and the requirements of the task. In studies with event-related potentials (ECP) in the auditory modality, modulations of early processing stages have been consistently observed (N1 effect). However, the influence of the type of attention steering and the task on the occurrence of this early auditory effect has not yet been systematically investigated. The aim of the experiments presented here is therefore to analyze the preconditions for the occurrence of early, perceptual ECP effects in the auditory modality. In addition, it should be clarified by means of magnetoencephalography which (neuronal) mechanisms underlie the early effects of auditory temporal attention and whether these mechanisms are the same ones that are also involved in other forms of attention (e.g., spatial attention).',\n",
       " 'Understanding the determinants of human cooperation is a central question in the social sciences. In recent years, a considerable literature has developed and identified conditional cooperation, i.e., the willingness to cooperate if others (are expected to) do so as well as a fundamental driving force. This concept, rooted in social psychology (Kelley & Stahelski, 1970), spirited many economic theories of social comparisons (see Fehr & Schmidt, 2006, for an overview). But whom do people compare to? Up to now the economic literature has primarily focused on comparisons to interaction partners, i.e. active players in the underlying game theoretic model. However, most of our real world interactions are embedded in a wider social context. Very recently it has been shown that comparison processes to inactive bystanders may play a crucial role for individuals¿ willingness to cooperate (Engel & Rockenbach, 2011). Furthermore, a recent paper by Böhm and Rockenbach (2013) shows that the mere comparison of cooperation rates to a structurally independent group promotes (intragroup) cooperation. These studies provide strong evidence that we should broaden our focus beyond the boundaries of the direct interaction partners. But, if comparisons are not restricted to interaction partners, the selection of comparison standards becomes an information search and selection problem. The proposed research integrates psychological research on social comparisons and economic research on cooperation and fairness, to enlarge the perspective of comparison processes for human decision making in economic situations. Specifically we will investigate 1. How subjects interacting in a cooperation dilemma react to social comparisons to outsiders; 2. Which social comparison information of outsiders subjects in an allocation game seek and which information they avoid; and 3. Which social comparison information subjects seek when making fairness judgments. Our research aims at providing valuable insights into the antecedents, consequences and psychological processes of social comparisons in economic situations and ultimately at providing the basis for a refinement and advancement of current economic models and theories in the domain of social comparisons and economic decision making.

       " 'In the context of the planned dissertation project of Mr. Florian Hauser M.A. The communication space between the north-western Alpine royal seat and northern Italy with the Caput Adriae and its development during the recent Hallstatt and early La Tène period will be examined. The basis of the application is also the master\\'s thesis of Mr. Hauser completed in 2005 in Mainz with the title \"Studies on the Iron Age site Nußdorf, Lkr. Traunstein and will form one of the foundations of the work.Bisher first of all the contacts with the Greek colony Massalia as relevant It is believed that the leading Western routes across the Rhone Valley and the Western Alps played a crucial role in the development of the relationship between the Late Hallstatt princely seats and the Mediterranean world. However, a more differentiated picture now seems to prevail, as a result of which different phases of contacts can be worked out, which are spatially different. Thus, new finds of the most easterly located princely seat on the Ipf near Bopfingen, Ostalbkreis and long known finds from the Heuneburg near Hundersingen, Kr. Sigmaringen also bear witness to contacts to the eastern Norditaiien and the Caput Adriae. The lines of communication are likely to have passed through southern Bavaria into the Inn-Salzach region, where, with the salt deposits on the Dürrnberg, there is a place which, because of its apparently supraregional importance, can be referred to as the so-called central location, and from there further across the Alps to northern Italy and the Caput Adriae. Presumably, there were several routes that changed with time in course and meaning, here certainly also those that ran directly over the Alps, for example, through the Inn or Loisachtal.Ziel the work of Mr. Hauser it is this eastern To describe the communication space between Fürstensitzkreis and the Mediterranean world and to grasp and characterize the communication lines that run through it. In addition, the cultural and socio-political influences of the princely seats on this area and the underlying processes are to be investigated. Special emphasis should be placed on the diachronous representation, since already at this time of the material recording dynamic processes emerge, whose backgrounds are to be illuminated. A first step will be the study of the cultural norms of the eastern contact zone between the north-western alpine Fürstensitzkreis and the Mediterranean world, d. H. in other words, regulatory mechanisms that made exchange in this specific form possible in the first place. From the acquired image of cultural and traditional idiosyncrasies, foreign influences should be made clearer, thereby making it possible to identify communication paths that run through the area. In the course of this, it will be necessary to clarify whether there were certain places with a high degree of central functions over which the contacts between the North West Alpine royal circle and the Mediterranean Sea have expired and whether a social elite can be found in this intermediate zone which has been the bearer of this exchange This would certainly also provide important insights into the interaction between the princely seat circle and its eastern periphery, which in turn allows conclusions to be drawn about the developments in the so-called Fürstensitzkreis can be drawn yourself.',\n",
       " 'Evolutionary models have been part and parcel of economics for a long time. A specific class of such models has been developed within game theory. In usual parlance, evolutionary game theory means the combination of evolutionary approaches with non-cooperative games. Particularly close to the theory of evolution in biology are replicator dynamics.So far, only few efforts have been taken to combine evolutionary approaches with cooperative game theory. This is what this projects aims at. We develop and analyze replicator dynamics that are based on cooperative games, particularly with respect to stable populations.In the first part of the project, we study replicator dynamics that are derived from cooperative games with transferable utility (TU games) by help of the Lovász-Shapley solution (Casajus and Wiese, forthcoming, IJGT). Players are regarded as types of agents and their weights as the sizes of the populations of agents of these types. In order to handle them, we have to apply the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side (Filippov, 1988). We establish the relation between the stable populations in these dynamics and the underlying TU games as well as other solution concepts for TU games.The Lovász-Shapley solution is based on a Leontief type technology, i.e., the types are complements. Alternatively, one could consider a technology, where the types are perfect substitutes, or, more generally, technologies that can be described by CES production functions. In the second part of the project, we generalize the Lovász-Shapley solution for these production functions using a construction of Casajus und Wiese (forthcoming, IJGT). We analyze these CES solutions and compare their properties with those of the Lovász-Shapley solution.In the third part of the project, we extend the analysis of the first part to the CES solutions.

       " \"Spatial visual attention plays a crucial role in many aspects of visual perception. Examples of attention-driven perceptual performance include the discrimination of visual details, the perception of synchronicity and the perception of transsaccal stability of visual stimuli. Spatial attention is also critical to the generation of purposeful movements, of which saccadic eye movements are particularly well studied. In general, there is a strong coupling between saccade programming and attentional control, which is expressed by the fact that attention is shifted towards the saccade target during the saccade's preparation phase (before movement begins). In human and nonhuman primates we can distinguish two groups of saccades, the reflexive and the intentional saccades. These two saccade types differ in their dynamic and metric properties. There is also evidence that reflexive and intentional attention shifts are two separate mechanisms. In this point, different attention-driven perceptual performances are to be interrogated at different times before reflexive or before intentional saccades. By comparing the latency of the saccades and the speed of attention shift, as well as between the saccade's point of landing and that of attention, the relationship between saccade control and other attention-seeking processing performances will be examined. This could provide clues as to how far the generally established distinction between reflexive and intentional saccades is based on differences in the underlying spatial attention mechanisms. In order to obtain information about the physiological and anatomical foundations of the relationship between saccadic control and attention control, it is to be investigated whether in diseases of the cerebellum or the basal ganglia, which are known to be associated with specific disorders of the reflexive and intentional saccades, respectively Attention mechanisms are impaired. This would speak for an anatomical separation of this attention control.\",\n",
       " 'Inattentional blindness (IB), the failure to notice fully visible unexpected events when attention is otherwise occupied, occurs in a wide variety of contexts and with many different tasks. Despite more than a decade of research on IB, relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying such failures of awareness. The diverse perceptual failures grouped under this single rubric might reflect the operation of a single attention limit or they could reflect the operation of several distinct attention mechanisms. The methods for inducing IB can be grouped into two distinct classes: failures to notice unexpected events that fall outside the spatial focus of attention and failures to notice unexpected events when central resources are limited. The proposed research will isolate and explore these possible mechanisms for IB by testing the impact of individual difference variables that should be associated with just one of these mechanisms. Understanding how different mechanisms contribute to IB is essential for a complete understanding of this sort of failure of awareness, and it also might help to find ways to limit their practical consequences.

       " 'Representations of familiar and unfamiliar faces appear to differ strongly (for a review see Johnston & Edmonds, 2009). This raises the question what characterizes the representational transition during face learning. Crucially, there is a change from an inflexible and image dependent representation to a mental representation that can be activated by a broad range of very different images of a known person. As yet, the precise mechanisms by which such a change is achieved are only beginning to be understood. In everyday life, the ability to recognize faces is an important prerequisite for successful social interactions. More recently, individual differences in this ability receive increasing scientific attention, but the functional mechanisms underlying these differences are still largely unknown. During the first funding period, we created a large stimulus data base of famous 2D and unfamiliar 2D and 3D faces, and generated face averages as well as photorealistic 2D and 3D caricatures. Using these stimuli, we conducted a series of EEG experiments, in which we investigated neural correlates of face learning, with a particular focus on effects of distinctiveness, caricaturing and attractiveness. In addition, we studied the role of stimulus variability and contrasted face learning with pure image learning. Furthermore, we investigated the functional relationship between face and voice processing, testing cognitive models of person perception. In the second funding period we will extend research on face learning, with a strong focus on individual differences. We assume that face learning and recognition skills show convergent validity vis-à-vis established measures of social competence and discriminant validity vis-à-vis psychometric intelligence. Furthermore, we will investigate the predictive validity of face learning capacity regarding real-life outcomes in the domain of interpersonal functioning, such as job performance, partner- and other relationships. If face learning skill proves as an aspect of “social competence”, we expect significant advantages in these domains for good face recognizers. Another important aspect of this project is that it will provide crucial information for the development of training strategies for clinical and non-clinical groups suffering from poor face recognition skills. By combining methods and expertise from experimental psychology, cognitive neurosciences and differential psychology, we expect substantial progress in the understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying face learning. The project will therefore contribute to bridging the gap between the study of basic perceptual processes and higher order social functioning. Using the large stimulus data base available, we will record performance and EEG data, scan paths and electro-dermal responses for the study of face learning and recognition, as well as the range and the quality of individual differences in these abilities. The relationship between behavioural, neurophysiological, and psychometric individual difference variables will be explored by means of structural equation modelling. ',\n",
       " 'Pain is a common, worldwide health problem. Pain is not merely somatic: 80% of back pain cases, for example, do not present with a somatic cause. Therefore, it is important to look at psychological factors, such as cognition and emotion, which play important roles in pain development and maintenance. A cognitive factor influencing pain, positively correlated with pain intensity, pain-related distress and disability, is attention towards pain. A preferential allocation of attention towards pain, to the cost of other information in the environment, is called a pain-related attentional bias, and is linked to the development of disability and chronic pain. It is currently unclear how a pain-related attentional bias can be optimally mitigated, although studies on anxiety disorders suggest that it can be influenced by cognitive control strategies. However, to date no studies have examined this key issue in the field of pain.The proposed project aims to elucidate this influence of cognitive pain control strategies on attentional biases towards pain. The experiment will include a manipulation of two strategies, employed to control pain during a painful stimulation: thought suppression and focused distraction. The essential question is: Is it better to just not think about pain (thought suppression - Do not think about the pain!), or to think a concrete other thought instead (focused distraction - Think about a Hawaiian beach!)? This is a subtle but important difference. In thought suppression, there is a rebound effect, causing the suppressed thoughts to resurface stronger than before. Thought suppression and attentional biases have been jointly studied in anxiety disorders, suggesting a causal relationship. No such effects are known in focused distraction. The proposed study is the first endeavour to translate these findings into the field of pain.Healthy subjects will be instructed to employ the two strategies during a cold pain induction. After the pain, it is tested with a dot-probe task whether the two pain control strategies differently influence an attentional bias towards pain. Anxiety is assessed as a covariate and a potential moderator of this relationship.The expected results have both theoretical and practical use: First, they could clarify the mechanisms with which attention and pain work together. Second, they could simplify pain treatment, if thought suppression causes an attentional bias towards pain, while focused distraction prevents it. Thought suppression is often spontaneously employed by the patients, while learning focused distraction in treatment would then be a much simpler and more effective strategy to control pain. It could be employed as a part of treatment as well as a preliminary measure for patients on the wait list. ',\n",
       " 'Executive processes are inter alia involved in the coordination of duplicate tasks. Recent work assumes that executive processes in duplicate control the timing of potentially conflicting processing in an efficient manner. The result of such control can be thought of as a double overhead cost, i. An increase in the processing times - or missing in the joint processing of a task compared to the processing of individual tasks are observed. However, recent findings have shown that special training reduces these duplication of tasks. As a main focus, the present application seeks to investigate the causes for the disappearance of the double-task costs after a long training period. Two alternatives should be checked. According to the first alternative, the subjects acquire generalized executive knowledge during long double-tasking training, which enables the cognitive system to perform the dual-task without interference. According to the second alternative, it is believed that the disappearance of the double overheads comes about through the formation of direct associations between stimuli and responses that allow for interference-free processing and eliminate the need for additional executive processes. The second important aim of the present application is to ask about the neuronal changes that arise when learning the double-task coordination. In particular, functional magnetic resonance tomography is used to investigate whether or not the disappearance of the double task costs during long training is associated with a reorganization of the involved neural structures.',\n",
       " '(abridged): The studies described here investigate the hypothesis that in cognitive symptoms of depression, such as pondering about negative events, the selective observation of negative stimuli and the selective memory of negative experiences, a dysfunction manifests itself in a cognitive mechanism, underlying the selective attentional conduits: the cognitive inhibition of irrelevant stimuli. Such an inhibitory deficit is considered to be an essential aspect of depressive vulnerability. Three central questions are in the foreground of the planned studies: (a) the diagnostic specificity of the abnormalities found; (b) the stability of abnormalities beyond the acute depressive episode, and (c) the question of the relationship of inhibitory dysfunction with pondering, selective attention to negative stimuli, and selective retrieval of negative memories. The results are expected to provide new insights into the extent to which cognitive abnormalities of depression contribute to the maintenance of the disorder as well as to the vulnerability to the repeated experience of depressive episodes.',\n",

Many sufferers suffer serious impairments in key areas of life and function and are at high risk for further developmental deficits. The planned investigation is based on a psychobiologically based model of the development and maintenance of depressive disorder. 2 main questions will be examined. (I) How are depressive children characterized for stress related factors? For this purpose, a controlled cross-sectional study will be carried out, in which depressive children are compared both on psychological and on biological level with a healthy control group. On the psychological level, the existing stress symptoms and stress coping strategies are recorded. At the biological level, the function of the hypothalamic pituitary pituitary axis is checked by means of the indicator cortisol under both stimulation conditions (acute stress) and basal (awakening reaction). (II) Which stress-related factors contribute most to the maintenance of the depressive disorder? For this purpose, a longitudinal study is to be carried out, in which the children are diagnosed a second time 6 months after the initial examination with regard to their depressive symptoms and the stress-related biological and psychological variables. The factors collected at baseline are then used as predictors of the course of depression and their weight is reviewed. The results of the study can provide crucial information for the design of stress-related components in prevention and treatment programs.',\n",
       " 'Visual object representation mainly contains 2 processes. On the one hand the perceptual processing of object features, on the other hand the semantic processes of object-related knowledge. The present project investigates the neural mechanisms for integrating these processes in the human brain. Here, the main focus is on event-related gamma-band responses (brain responses with a frequency> 25 Hz). These are seen as a neural signature of cortical network formation for object representation. Based on our preliminary studies, we want to show that evoked gamma-band responses, which occur with a latency of about 100 ms after the start of the stimulus, are not a signature of fast memory processes - as postulated in the model of Hermann and colleagues - but rather the feature processing of visual objects are coupled. In contrast, semantic processes exclusively modulate induced gamma-band responses, which occur with a latency of about 300 ms. However, both evoked and induced gamma-bound responses can be modulated via top-down processes. But each other topdown processes play a role. If evoked gamma-ray responses are predominantly modulated top-down through attention-grabbing processes that influence early perceptual processing, \"higher\" cognitive processes play a predominant role in induced gamma-ray responses, such as specific object knowledge (such as bananas are yellow). To our knowledge, the proposed experiments of this project are the first systematic studies investigating the role of event-related gamma-band responses in perceptual and semantic processes of cortical object representation. The expected results provide elementary contributions to the understanding of everyday information processing in the human brain.',\n",

While previous studies have shown that mortality solicitation motivates individuals to behave more materialistically, the purpose of the present application is to examine the conditions under which the odds of owning one's mortality can influence money management in a prosocial manner. It is hypothesized that upon activation of appropriate cultural norms, e.g. Charity, kindness, or fairness, a prosocial way of dealing with money can help people reduce their fear of their own mortality.\",\n",
       " 'In the last years researchers demonstrated several specific links between music lessons and various specific cognitive abilities. This huge amount of specific links led Schellenberg (2004,2006) to the conclusion that a domain general cognitive ability is influenced by music lessons and explains all the specific links. Indeed Schellenberg (2004) showed that music lessons enhance IQ. However, the nature of this association remains unclear: Do music lessons directly influence IQ or is it an indirect influence that is mediated by another cognitive ability? Potential mediators are executive functions. However, recent correlational studies revealed controversial results. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the current project is to investigate the role of executive functions for the influence of music lessons on IQ. Two questions should be clarified. First, the question whether the influence of music lessons on IQ is mediated by executive functions in a sample of 5- to 7-year-old children should be investigated. Therefore, it needs to be shown that music lessons enhance executive functions and that this enhancement explains the influence of music lessons on IQ. To answer this question firmly two experiments will be conducted. An experimental design will solve the matter of causation. With the second experiment differential effects of music lessons on executive functions will be investigated. Hence, 5- to 6-year-old children will be trained with music programs that focus either on rhythmic activities or singing. Thus, it will be possible to compare the effects different musical activities might have on executive functions. ',\n",
       " \"The project pursues the goal to describe the pseudepigraphy of the First Epistle to Timothy regarding its pragmatics. For the first time a study of the letters pseudepigraphy is based on the result - resting on recent studies on the Pastoral Epistles - that the letter is best understood as an unattached pseudepigraph. Previous studies on the pseudepigraphy of the New Testament epistle did usually grasp the text as part of a coherent Corpus Pastorale, in which the First Epistle to Timothy is building a literary unity with the two other Pastoral Epistles (2 Tim and Tit). Regarding the analysis of the pragmatics the question whether the text was planned as a deception or a transparent fiction is of peculiar interest. To answer this question it is necessary to consider the intertextual relations between the First Epistle to Timothy and older early Christian writings. Thereby the many-faceted phenomena of pseudepigraphy in New Testament times and the pragmatics of the First Epistle to Timothy have to be collated. The various dependencies also determine the dating of the text in the group of early Christian writings. The project will presumable establish the First Epistle to Timothy as the latest New Testament writing, in contrary to the so far predominant view of scholars. In the midst of the second century the letter takes up position in a controversy on the appropriate structures of communities and is involved in a creative discussion of earlier schemes, which is especially discernible by focussing the instructions for different groups of persons. These instructions presuppose possibly Polycarp's letter to the Philippians. The First Epistle to Timothy could therefore represent an interface to the non-canonical writings. Previous approaches were not able to conceive suitably the pragmatics of the pseudepigraphical First Epistle to Timothy, because they did not determine the intertextual dependencies correctly. Either they have taken the epistle as part of a larger Corpus Pastorale or they were dating the letters of the Corpus Pastorale too early. \",\n",
       " 'As an extension of prior findings illustrating the modulation of the conflict monitoring intensity by means of required effort and aversive reinforcement we aim at investigating conflict monitoring and passive avoidance learning in the context of recent theories on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity. For several years, both researchers have successfully collaborated as a dual-career couple as they officially do since 2012 at the University of Bonn. Till date, the neural processes of conflict monitoring and passive avoidance learning as one form of reinforcement learning have been investigated rather independently. However, as long as it has not yet been investigated whether, as postulated by Botvinick, an intensified conflict monitoring results in an intensified passive avoidance learning during task performance, we cannot conclude that an intensified conflict monitoring serves as an aversive teaching signal in decision-making processes and during passive avoidance learning. Those findings would, however, further the most recent and extensive theoretical debate on the functional relevance of the ACC. One possibility to enhance the conflict monitoring intensity and subsequent passive avoidance learning is the quasi-experimental manipulation of motivational factors. In this respect, in Study 1 we aim at varying an individuals motivation by using a maximal vs. average cognitive effort trial-by-trial treatment during performance of a discrimination task. We expect that an increased conflict monitoring intensity induced by means of an individuals effort motivation should intensify passive avoidance learning. If an intensified conflict monitoring and subsequently an intensified passive avoidance learning are of importance for every-day contexts the effect of intensified conflict monitoring on avoidance learning should generalize to discrimination tasks that are embedded into every-day contexts. In Study 2, participants perform discrimination tasks that are based on a vignette describing a more natural context. The possibility to induce conflict monitoring and passive avoidance learning by means of a discrimination task based on faces and a discrimination task based on a vignette has been shown in preliminary studies. Moreover, the presence of peers is manipulated in order to modulate conflict monitoring and thereby passive avoidance learning. To test our hypotheses, well-known event-related potentials are assessed by means of a multi-channel electroencephalogram along with behavioral parameters in large samples (more than 120 participants per study). To investigate the direct relations of individual differences in conflict monitoring and passive avoidance learning growth-modeling is applied as an innovative statistical analysis tool. ',\n",
       " \"The research project explores the relationship between preschool composition and children's language skills at school entry. Children with deprived backgrounds, uneducated parents or an ethnic minority status are especially at-risk of having specific developmental disorders of speech and language or poor language proficiency. This refers to the critical role of the ecological context in which children grow up and the respective quantity and quality of exposure to linguistic input in these contexts. Against this background, observed segregation processes in early childhood education and the subsequent concentration of at-risk children in some preschool settings might impact children's developmental and educational outcomes. The proposed study investigates a) if the proportion of at-risk children in preschool settings affects the language skills of all children and, if so, which composition factors are decisive, and b) if differential effects can be observed for subgroups of children. Using the example of a medium-sized city in North Rhine-Westphalia (Muenster, which has a population of about 300,000), data are taken from the school entry examination (SEE) in the years from 2010/11 to 2014/2015 (n = 12,500 children). The SEE does not only measure children's language competencies but also collects information on various individual-level background characteristics such as family background, migration or biological risk-factors. As it is known which preschool a child attends, it is possible to aggregate the data on setting level. Paper-and-pencil interviews generate additional information on the settings' structural quality and language-oriented activities (n = 172 preschools). Multi-level analyses allow the identification of preschool composition effects on all children's language skills. Further subgroup-analyses are employed to detect differential effects for subpopulations like children without sufficient parental support or bilingual children. Research findings will provide empirical evidence regarding the potentials and limitations of early language education in preschools. \",\n",
       " \"Prior studies provided evidence for negative effects of projected slides on the acquisition of knowledge about information that was presented only orally. This project investigates whether with projected slides learners (a) process this information to a lesser extent than without slides or (b) process this information but regard itas less central and hence take notes about it less frequently, and thereby acquire less knowledge about it. In the second case this information should occur more frequently in notes taken on handouts containing the information presented on slides than in notes taken on plain paper. In the proposed study learners watch a life-size projection of the video recording of a presentation. The factors slide projection (without vs. with) and form of note-taking (on plain paper vs. on handouts) are manipulated experimentally. For one half of the learners in each condition the video is interrupted several times in order to measure the processing of information presented only orally. Furthermore, the learners' notes are analyzed for coverage of information presented only orally. Knowledge about the information presented only orally is tested immediately as well as two weeks later after a rehearsal phase for which the learners will use their notes. This allows for a decision between competing explanations and may yield suggestions for potential instructional cures. \",\n",
       " 'Recent theories state that consciousness is related to the integration and accessibility of information. From this it follows that mental functions exist which do not operate at all or at least operate in an impaired way when consciousness is impaired. More specifically, processing of simple (non-integrated) stimulus features should be independent from consciousness whereas semantic processing of complex (integrated) features should increase with an increasing consciousness of the stimuli. A series of empirical reports support this view. Thus, early perceptual or motor priming effects do not depend on the prime visibility whereas semantic priming effects seem to depend on prime visibility. However, in many studies the manipulation of prime visibility has been confounded with the duration of the primes because trials with short and long prime durations have been compared as unconscious and conscious conditions, respectively. Additionally, semantic studies most often used pattern masking which might produce an artificial correlation between priming effects and prime visibility. Independence of motor priming effects and visibility has been reported frequently from studies that used metacontrast masking. And indeed, our pilot studies show that semantic and motor priming effects depend on prime visibility when pattern masking is used, but not with metacontrast masking. Beyond this, the relation between priming effects and prime visibility could also depend on the processing of the primes which is needed to generate priming effects. The planned project comprises 13 experiments which systematically compare the effects of three different masking procedures (pattern masking, metacontrast, and crowding) when the same stimuli are used in different tasks. Within each experiment, prime visibility is varied by masks of a specific type but with different masking strength and the relationship between priming effects and visibility is recorded. If the processing of the primes in a certain task depends on consciousness of the primes the priming effect should also depend on prime visibility. To grasp also discontinuous relationships, the time that is given to the prime to generate its effects is varied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to examine whether the prime induced cortical activation at later levels of processing in the visual hierarchy is systematically determined by the type of masking procedure used. In this way the expansion of the effects of masked stimuli in the brain and the loci of masking can be directly investigated. The studies of this project contribute to confine the search for the function of consciousness and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that produce priming effects and the different types of masking effects.

The concrete forms of the principles and their interaction in English should be confronted with those in German.

       " 'Typically, people speak in the context of social interaction. Yet, surprisingly little is known about how the neuro-cognitive processes of language production are shaped by social interaction. Drawing upon a well-established effect in language production we investigate the degree of semantic interference experienced when naming a sequence of pictures together with a task partner. In single subject settings, naming latencies increase with each new picture of a given semantic category, so-called cumulative semantic interference (e.g., Howard et al., 2006). Recently, it has been demonstrated that naming latencies not only increase in response to speakers’ own prior naming of semantically related pictures, but also in response to their task partner naming pictures (Hoedemaker, Ernst, Meyer, & Belke, 2017; Kuhlen & Abdel Rahman, 2017). This suggests that task partners represent each other’s actions and engage in lexicalization on behalf of their partner. Based on these findings we want to specify (1) the mechanism behind partner-elicited semantic interference, (2) the extent to which lexical access on behalf of the partner reflects the specific nature of the partner’s task (and not just the own task), and (3) whether partner-elicited lexical access depends on characteristics of the task partner or the task setting. Finally, we want to understand (4) how our findings within the framework of joint picture naming scale up to conversation. We expect insights into these questions through a series of experiments based on behavioral observations of latencies during joint picture naming and electrophysiological, event-related recordings. The results from the here proposed project will contribute to a better understanding of language production during social interaction as well as deepen our understanding of how flexibly the semantic system adapts to social context.

       " 'The research project takes up the concept of the study PISA 2003 and PISA-MW 2004 (measurement repetition) and pursues goals on two levels. Based on the results of the TIMSS, PISA and IGLU studies, there is extensive data on the level of basic mathematical education among German students. In contrast, however, there is little insight into what the profile of adult mathematics in Germany looks like. One aim of the present study is therefore to describe the mathematical competence of an adult sample (n = 400) descriptively with a test instrument to be developed. The conception of the Adult Mathematics Test should - according to the state-of-the-art - be based on the theoretically coherent PISA framework for the acquisition of Mathematical Literacy. The measurement is operationalized by task classes. The test provides scaled indicators of sub-competences and competence levels for describing the content of mathematical basic education levels. The adult sample should consist of the parents of the students from 30 classes (15 schools) of the PISA-MW 2004 sample. The second aim is to investigate the role of parental mathematics competence as an extracurricular family condition variable for the genesis of mathematical competence in children. To achieve this, the competency values \\u200b\\u200bof the parents should be assigned to the student data obtained in the PISA study. Specifically, on the one hand, exploratory analysis should be made of how parental mathematics competence is related to mathematical educational action. On the other hand, the relation between parental mathematical competence and student variables such as mathematical appreciation, motivation and competence should be investigated.',\n",
       " \"Four larger studies are to lead to a comprehensive picture of the syntax, semantics and prosody of Turkish questions, and to a range of contributions to the cross-linguistic literature on the interfaces that are involved.1. Turkish wh-in-situ ('Ali WHAT ate?') attracts sentence stress, unlike moved wh-words in English and German ('What did Ali EAT?') Studying the difference in controlled contexts allows us to investigate this effect relative to the effects of given, new, and focused elements.2. Descriptions of Turkish intonation involve stress-retraction to the wh-word, a final rise in whquestions, and an initial plateau. A phonetic study establishes the existence and crucial phonological/phonetic details of these.3. Untypical questions (rhetorical, echo, etc.) show untypical combinations of wh-words, the question marker -mI, and the intonational markers. They are crucial to establishing the meanings of these elements.4. -mI suffixes to each alternative in alternative questions ('JOHN-mI or BILL-mI dinner cooked?'). Turkish yes/no-questions allow a 'single alternative' version of this ('JOHN-mI dinner cooked?') This allows us to address open issues in the cross-linguistic literature on alternative questions. \",\n",
       " 'Seeing as the different kinds of relationships between human beings and animals have historically developed and are socio-culturally formed, in my research I have investigated the effects of SED ideology and policy on the relations between human and non-human animals, social representations of animals and the living conditions of animals. My focus is on the socio-geographical realms of pet keeping and animal husbandry as well as the policies of animal protection. ',\n",
       " 'Individual risk perception is central to any form of decision making and its accurate empirical measurement is a prerequisite for practical applicability of many economic models. A valid econometric assessment of individual risk attitudes requires precise but tractable estimates of marginal utility in Euler equations associated with optimal intertemporal consumption choice. For these elements of key economic interest, however, available standard analytical techniques depend on simplifying model assumptions to treat data challenges such as nonstationary consumption and unknown correct functional form specification of utility. But in practice, it is often these technical conditions which drive the overall results and have thus produced various well-known empirical puzzles as e.g. the equity premium puzzle with ambiguous and contradicting estimates of individual risk perception. In order to avoid such restrictions, we develop general statistical techniques for such nonstandard conditions aiming to obtain novel insights of practical and economic relevance. In particular, our methods do not require parametric pre-specifications of utility functions but can flexibly determine their form from the data. Furthermore, these non- and semiparametric techniques are sufficiently general to allow for consistent estimation and testing with nonstationary but recurrent consumption entering utility in levels and not in stationary growth rates. In this sense, the methods are of cointegration type. The focus of this project is on semiparametric models which still allow for a flexible model fit but yield substantial improvements to the poor feasibility of pure nonparametric methods in available sample sizes of nonstationary consumption. In particular, we investigate estimation with recursive utility specifications and Epstein-Zin preferences for which many calibration studies have shown promising results. We expect that such general model classes can significantly improve on the practical performance of intertemporal optimization models providing a new understanding of some of the present puzzles.

       " 'The current study sets out to investigate the following key questions: (1) Does laboratory induced exposure to thin ideals relate to psychological impairments in terms of body image, affect and eating behavior in 18 to 35 year old female suffering from anorexia and bulimia nervosa compared to female healthy controls and to a sample of females suffering from mixed mental disorders (depression and somatoform disorders)? (2) How do moderators such as cognitive distortions (Thought-Shape Fusion, TSF), and correlates of emotion regulation (ER) moderate the influence of the exposure to thin ideals. (3) Are these characteristics amenable to change after treatment? As a second focus it will be explored how exposure to media promoting the thin ideal relates to biological parameter of stress. We combine questionnaire-based and observational data and include biological measures of stress response such as saliva cortisol, alpha-amylase, heart rate and heart rate variability to assess impact of exposure to the thin ideal. To achieve these interdisciplinary goals, two research groups (Simone Munsch, University of Fribourg, Switzerland; Stephan Herpertz, LWL-University Bochum, Germany) provide their expertise for the investigation of ED pathology, negative affect, cognitive style, emotion regulation and psychological aspects of stress. A sample of 250 female participants including patients with AN, BN, depressive and somatoform disorders, and healthy women will be recruited in three collaborating Clinics in Switzerland and in the Clinic of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University of Bochum, Germany (SH). This project will provide pertinent findings about the role of moderators influencing the psychological and physiological effects of exposure to thin ideals promoted by mass media in AN and BN patients using an ecologically valid design. Comparing this susceptibility in ED patients to healthy participants and patients suffering from other mental disorder in a cross and longitudinal design will contribute to a better understanding of psychopathological mechanisms maintaining EDs and distinctions from depressive and somatoform disorders. Findings could be used to develop tailored interventions including a training in ER competences as well as cognitive restructuring of distorted beliefs about the own body shape and weight. ',\n",
       " \"In this research project we analyze the transition process from unemployment to employment. Thereby we focus on the determinants of reservation wages and the type and intensity of job search as well as their impact on unemployment duration. Both components depend on factors like education, age, unemployment benefits and household composition. Next to these 'classical' variables the process may depend on factors like personality traits or social networks, which are usually unobservable for the econometrician.In addition to administrative data we base our analysis on unique survey data containing a large inflow sample of unemployed. Individuals are interviewed shortly after entering unemployment and are followed over time for up to three years. This data set allows us to observe individual job search intensity, reservation wages and job offers at different points in time as well as realized transitions into employment. Risk aversion, locus of control and social networks are part of the rich information and will help us to understand the determinants of the transition process from unemployment to employment more deeply. Identifying the underlying key factors will give us valuable information for improving the employment probability of individuals with a high risk of long-term unemployment like low skilled or elderly workers. \",\n",
       " 'Recent findings from multimedia laboratory studies suggest that spoken text in multimedia messages yields superior learning outcomes than written text for delivering instructional explanations accompanying dynamic visualizations (animations). Research on text comprehension, on the other hand, demonstrates distinct processing advantages of written over spoken forms of communication, which should be particularly observable whenever learners can determine their speed of reading, have to deal with complex texts, vary with regard to the amount of prior knowledge they possess, and whenever sustainability of knowledge is the main learning objective. Under these conditions adaptive reading strategies, which are not available with transient spoken text, are most helpful to foster understanding. These conditions are often given in the classroom, but are usually absent in multimedia laboratory studies. We thus aim at investigating possible interactions between the presentation mode for verbal information in multimedia messages, individual learning prerequisites, and instructional conditions in classroom settings. We expect that this research will help to refine multimedia design recommendations regarding the combination of dynamic visualizations and verbal information in a way that allows for developing effective materials to be used in classrooms.

       " \"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has proven to be a valuable tool for the detection of cortical activation and inhibition by muscle vibration (MV). In addition, TMS and in particular the modern possibility of repetitive TMS (rTMS) will be used to influence sensorimotor processes. In experiments on the 'Simon effect' and the reaction to masked visual stimuli, rTMS should be applied over frontal and parietooccipital areas in order to draw conclusions about the involved structures. The cortical processing of MV is to be further analyzed in experiments on 'illusionary movements' using TMS. The inclusion of patients with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear paralysis, Huntington's chorea, and focal dystonia in the above studies will provide important insights into the role of basal ganglia in thalamocortical activation and the pathophysiology of the disease. The planned experiments are mainly carried out in cooperation with other SPP groups.\"]"
