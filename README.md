# Analyzing-interdisciplinary-categories
 
## Goal

To address the lot of academic and industry research problems, a researcher needs a combined approach. The interdisciplinary research (IDR) is crucial for the current research area and it helps to solve the problem from multifarious views. Here, we identify the interdisciplinary research from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation). We use cosine similarity with the help of embedding to find the interdisciplinary. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze the interdisciplinary topics and find the relevant connection between the categories. Finally, we show the impressive visualization using the new visualization technique results for interdisciplinary topics and understanding dependencies. Together, this work provides a new groundwork to understand the IDR in DFG and relation to existing categories.
