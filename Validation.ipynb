       "['The main task of this proposal is the rigorous mathematical treatment of a localized modelling of geophysical fields, the development of improved techniques to derive the space-time structure of the gravity field, the implementation of these improvements in the ITG Gravity field Recovery Software package to determine precise global gravity field models with regional focus from the original level-1 observations and, most important for the various proposals of this SPP1257, the assimilation of the gravity field products into oceanographic, hydrologic, glaciological and geophysical models referred to selected regions. Various mass transport phenomena in the Earth system are regionally bounded and the inhomogeneous mass distributions are reflected in geographically varying gravity field functionals. These functionals cause signals with varying strength and can be detected with high precision by the innovative sensors of the new gravity and altimetric satellites. Therefore, regional space-time structures of the gravity field shall be derived by tailored modelling and analysis techniques based on the line-of-sight observations of the GRACE twin-satellites as well as on the observational functionals of the gravity gradiometry mission GOCE. The regional gravity field structures modelled by space-time localizing base functions and consistently embedded into a datum referenced mean global solution shall be assimilated with the corresponding oceanographic, hydrologic, glaciologic and geophysical models provided by the various projects of SPP 1257. Alternative observables as derived from the altimetric satellites as well as terrestrial and airborne gravity field measurements shall be integrated consistently into the assimilation procedure. From the mathematical point of view the discrepancy of a rigorous localisation with the intrinsic non-locality of solutions of the Laplace equation for the gravitational potential shall be investigated. Besides these basic mathematical problems of a regional modelling of the gravity field with space-localising base functions algorithms shall be developed to find statistically justified procedures to model the mass distribution and the various mass transport phenomena in the Earth system.

       " 'Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is a staple food for the majority of people living in the semi-arid areas of the Sudanian-Sahelian zone of Africa but average grain yields are low and variable. Results of published research experiments have demonstrated that sorghum hybrids may display considerable heterosis particularly for grain yield. However, hybrid breeding is not an economic option for most Sudanese sorghum growing areas at present. Developing synthetic varieties with a substantially raised outcrossing rate is considered a promising alternative to enhance yield and stress tolerance. In the caudatum race which prevails in Sudan, the outcrossing rate varies around 16% depending on race, genotype and environment. In our project we want to increase the outbreeding level by recurrent selection (RS) employing molecular markers. Highly heterozygous plants are most likely to have arisen from outcrossing and are likely to carry parental genes for high outcrossing aptitude. Such plants will be selected before flowering and transplanted to a pollen isolated crossing plot for starling a new RS cycle. We expect that four RS cycles can be completed during the project phase with an increase of the average outcrossing rate of about 0.05 per RS cycle. The base population for this project will be composed of about 100 caudatum race cultivars from Sudan. The gain from selection will be assessed in a final multi-location field experiment in the major growing areas of the country. ',\n",
       " 'Bracken covers about 40% of the pastures in the San Francisco valley and it is still spreading. Preliminary results suggest that “bracken” is composed of 2 species Pteridium arachnoideum and caudatum and several genetically differing lines. The taxonomic composition of bracken in the research area will be analysed using morphological characters, allozyme analysis and DNA-microsatellites. In a firetriggered succession, bracken outcompetes the pasture grass Setaria. This process is simulated by a model which is based on field measurements (ecological, ecophysiological, radiation data) assuming competition for light as the decisive factor. An extra module simulates the effect of burning on the competition. The model shall be extended to a third plant life form, the bush Baccharis latifolia, which is very common in the bracken-infested pastures. It shall also be applied to the effects of grazing and of bracken control measures which have been running for 2.5 years. The bracken control experiment has meanwhile merged in a repastorization experiment which shall be continued. Invasion and spreading of bracken since 1975 will be traced from Landsat scenes and the current appearance and further spreading of a bracken blight disease, a potential means of biocontrol shall be followed with QuickBird scenes.

       " 'We plan to establish a fully integrated and astronomically calibrated bio-, chemo-, and magnetostratigraphy at the equatorial Pacific for the Bartonian and Priabonian (41 to 34 Ma) to improve, date, and intercalibrate bio- and magnetostratigraphic datums. An accurate and precise age model is critical to unravel the cause and consequences of events across the Eocene/Oligocene climatic transition. Prerequisite is the correlation and integration of ODP Leg 199 (Sites 1218 through 1220) and IODP Expedition 320 (Sites U1331 through U1334) data (XRF core scanning, physical properties, bio- and magnetostratigraphy) for the middle to late Eocene and earliest Oligocene (magnetic polarity chrons C12n to C20n). The revised composite records will be used to validate and extend the astronomical calibration of the geological timescale into the middle Eocene. We plan to reconstruct the equatorial Pacific Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD) in detail by using calibrated high-resolution XRF core scanning data with the aim to address how and why the acidity of the oceans changed in association with shifts in the global Eocene climate. We further will explore the characteristics of the Carbonate Accumulation Events (CAE) and evaluate the relationship of the long-period carbonate cycles in the equatorial Pacific sediments to astronomical forcing. Finally, we would like to contribute to a new high-resolution (on orbital time-scales) record of stable isotopes from bulk sediments at four IODP Exp. 320 sites (U1331 through U1334) along a depth transect from the top of magnetic polarity chron C15n through the base of C12r across the Eocene/Oligocene transition (35 to 33 Ma).

       " 'In contrast to global, geometrically defined height systems, most national, physical height systems are related to an individual vertical datum, defined by the local mean sea surface observed at a specific tide gauge. Due to sea surface topography, the reference levels of different physical height systems are inconsistent by about 1-2 m at a global scale. However, for many global geodetic applications as well as the monitoring of geodynamic and climatological processes a unified global vertical datum is indispensable. Therefore, the primary objective of this research project is the development of methods for the determination of datum parameters that can be used to globally connect national height systems. In the first phase of the project, two methods of different accuracy have been developed and their performance was analyzed by conducting methodological and numerical investigations using test areas in Germany, Brazil, and Australia. For the first method, which is based on satellite observations and therefore particularly interesting from the view of countries with a limited geodetic infrastructure, cm-dm accuracy has been verified. To achieve a unification up to sub-cm level, a second method based on the solution of an extended fixed Geodetic Boundary Value Problem (GBVP) has been proposed and validated using a closed-loop simulation. In contrast to the first approach, terrestrial gravity data are additionally required. On the basis of the investigations and achieved results, the method of the extended fixed GBVP should be further developed and analyzed within the second phase of the research project. The main goal is the practical realization of the method in order to apply it to real observation data. In this context, the method has to be adapted considering the limited availability of globally distributed terrestrial gravity measurements. Thus, the global integration area needs to be restricted to a near zone covering regional high-resolution gravity data by applying a suitable modification of the integral kernel. Furthermore, in order to reduce systematic errors, a combination of terrestrial gravity data with satellite observations and topographic information should be realized by utilizing a remove-compute-restore approach. Both procedures, primarily used in gravimetric geoid determination based on the scalar free GBVP, need to be adapted to the present problem. Moreover, the second project phase should also be used to analyze all approximation errors in the spherical solution of the fixed GRWP that cause an impact of more than 1 mm. These efforts will result in a complete theory of the non-linear fixed GBVP for the topographical boundary surface, integrating suitable correction terms into the solution of the linearized problem in spherical and constant radius approximation.

       " 'Bangladesh, a low-lying, one of the most densely populated countries in the world located at the Bay of Bengal, is prone to transboundary monsoonal flooding, potentially aggravated by more frequent and intensified cyclones resulting from anthropogenic climate change. Sea-level rise, along with tectonic, sediment load and groundwater extraction induced land uplift/subsidence, have significantly exacerbate these risks and Bangladeshs coastal vulnerability. We propose to build a robust Belmont Challenge identified Earth System Analysis &amp; Prediction System (ESAPS) for Bangladesh, to adapt/mitigate the detrimental hazards including sea-level rise. We will establish an advanced observation system based on contemporary space geodetic sensors to quantify (1) causes of sea-level rise and land motion and their robust vertical datum link, and (2) humaninteractions that governs coastal vulnerability in Bangladesh. This knowledge will be used for the integrated development of a natural and social science framework employing robust predictive modeling towards the adaption of sea-level rise and other hazards in coastal Bangladesh. Our international, cross-disciplinary science team, consists of natural and social scientists including local stakeholders, will leverage upon ongoing environmental and social projects in the region. Our approach includes observation/fieldwork based syntheses to discern sea-level rise and land motion and their projections at century timescales, socioeconomic analyses including vulnerable population projection, micro adaptation, land use change, and community adaptive capacity, and integrated assessment including scenario analysis, dissemination, and decision-support service in coastal Bangladesh.The developed BanD-AID ESAPS prototype system is transportable to other regions of the world. Our work will both leverage and benefit other existing projects (e.g., Fulbright, NASA, NSF, ONR, USAID). The project will train students, technicians and social workers who will be the next-generation local stakeholders. ',\n",

Close the 'Eocene gap' and tie data into an absolute astrochronological age model; evaluate whether there is a relationship between dominant forcing response frequency and palaeoclimatic condition (presence of ice-sheets)2. Generate a high-resolution, astronomically tuned benthic and planktic foraminiferal (surface and thermocline) d13C and d18O time series for the Eocene (34-56 Ma), with a focus for this proposal to generate high resolution mixed layer and thermocline planktic stable isotope series within magnetochron C20r (~ca. 44.3-46.2 Ma Ma)3. Examine the magnitude (and sensitivity) of orbitally paced climate and carbon cycle dynamics across the Early to Late Eocene.4. Test hypotheses relating to the global nature of major Eocene carbon cycle events (Pälike et al., 2012), including the Equatorial Pacific Eocene-long deepening of the calcite compensation depth (CCD) and carbonate accumulation events (CAEs).The sedimentary successions from Expedition 342 are particularly useful to achieve these objectives because of continuous sedimentation throughout Eocene, with particularly high sedimentation rates in the middle to lower late Eocene, windows of excellent microfossil preservation, an excellent set of bio- and palaeomagnetic datums, and a key location to test hypotheses about Eocene deep water formation. \",\n",
       " 'The project shall investigate the possibility of realising directly and epoch-wise regional geocentric reference frames (RGRF) without the usual transformation onto a global reference system. Such reference frames are of particular importance in seismic active regions, where strong earthquakes (e.g. Chile 2010) produce large surface deformations (up to several meters), damage existent reference systems with station coordinates at a fixed epoch and linear coordinate changes, and disable their use. Also seasonal variations of air pressure and water storage produce sub-annual coordinate changes on the centimetre-level and complicate the application of existing reference systems in the interpretation of environmental changes. Regional reference frames are at present exclusively realised through measurements of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which enable the local access to the global geocentric reference systems because of their large number. In this project epoch RGRF shall be computed directly by combining GNSS with the geodetic techniques Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The origin of the epoch solutions will be realised by SLR, the scale by a weighted mean of SLR and VLBI. An epoch-wise realisation entails a variable SLR-Network configuration from epoch to epoch. This effect on geocentricity and a stable datum realisation need to be investigated. The project will be applied in practice to the geocentric reference frame for the Americas (SIRGAS). Regarding GNSS, it has to be studied how far the network for the combination needs to be extended beyond the present SIRGAS network in order to transfer the datum from SLR/VLBI optimally to SIRGAS. The project will be performed in close cooperation with scientists of the Argentine CONICET in the frame of a project for the installation of the Argentine-German Geodetic Observatory (AGGO). AGGO assembles the important geodetic observation techniques GNSS, SLR and VLBI and thus will be an important co-location station in the combination. A particular focus will be put on the benefit of AGGO for SIRGAS. In the frame of the collaboration, the Argentine side will establish an operational GNSS-SLR-VLBI combination centre. DGFI will provide the SLR and VLBI software. At DGFI, primarily the strategy of the direct combination in regional reference frames will be investigated. After completion of this project the computation of the epoch RGRF shall be continued in Argentina on a routine basis following the combination strategy derived from the findings of this project. DIGERATI has high scientific impact for investigations of the effect of environmental changes on global change, in particular in the topical regions of South America, which require highly precise reference systems. There is also a huge practical benefit in the common application of the SIRGAS coordinates, e.g., in regional geodesy, cadastre geographical information systems and land surveying. ',\n",
       " \"Astrometric radio source catalogs in general and the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) in particular represent the most accurate and most stable realizations of a quasi-inertial celestial reference system. While previous ICRFs were composed of a single VLBI solution of all available global S/X-band observations, the new (third) frame, ICRF-3, to be compiled in the next few years on request of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), will be a combined multi-frequency catalog. The reason is that by now a competitive solution of X/Ka-band observations from NASA/JPL is available, which will be combined with multiple solutions of S/X-band observations. The project, which is applied for in the framework of the Research Unit 1503 'Space-Time Reference Systems for Monitoring Global Change and for Precise Navigation in Space', will develop the necessary methods and procedures for the combination of multiple catalogs. New is the approach of using intermediate results of the least squares solutions of the observations namely normal equation systems instead of the source positions themselves. This method permits for the first time the transfer of the full variance-covariance information to the final catalog. Furthermore, the parameterization of unstable sources may be refined introducing linear splines where deemed appropriate following critical investigations. For the combination to work properly, i.e., without introducing frame constraints and other distortions, the input normal equation systems have to be free of datum constraints or have to be made datum-free. In the project, the final ICRF-3 catalog will be compiled in close collaboration with the IAU Working Group on the Third Realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame. \",\n",
       " 'In many applications from physics, engineering and economy, non-local operators are used to model the respective phenomenon. Such operators are characterised by the property that each output datum depends on each input datum when the operator is applied to a data set. Examples are integral operators arising from the boundary integral method, the Gauss transform, the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in quantum perturbation theory, non-integer powers and the inverse of differential operators. Also integral operators for modelling Levy processes in risk management belong to this class. Their discretization leads to fully populated matrices which due to the underlying geometry or the desired accuracy of the solution are large scale in general. Already storing such matrices can be a problem. However, the numerical solution of linear systems in which they appear as a coefficient matrix can currently not be done in acceptable time.In this project a new approach for the efficient numerical treatment of non-local operators will be developed and investigated. Both, the fast multipole method and hierarchical matrices can be employed to treat large scale discretizations of such operators with logarithmic-linear complexity. Depending on the respective method, the operator is approximated locally or blockwisewith the prescribed accuracy. The resulting approximation is universally applicable to any right hand side of linear systems in which it appears as a coefficient matrix. If many systems with the same operator are to be solved, then this kind of approximation is particularly efficient. However, often (probably in most cases) only a single system is to be solved for one operator, because it may, for instance, change in the course of a simulation. In such a situation, the universality of the approximation cannot be taken advantage of. On the contrary, the universality is paid for by generating and storing dispensable information. Since there are currently few alternatives, this kind of approximation is still used in practise. The aim of this project is to improve this situation by developing a new technique which tailors the approximation to the right hand side. Both, fast multipole methods and hierarchical matrices will be able to benefit from this new approach. Hence, succesful and widely recognised methods will be extended to significant problems to which they have not been efficiently applicable yet. ',\n",
       " 'The gravity field reflects the mass distribution of the Earth. Thus, it allows studying its inner structure and tectonic evolution. In this respect, it is important to gain precise knowledge of the geometry of specific boundary surfaces respectively surfaces of distinct density contrast such as the topography and the crust-mantle boundary (Mohorovicic discontinuity). In Antarctica, the subglacial topography that is covered by an ice sheet of up to 4,000 m thickness is of special interest. Additionally, the geoid as a distinct equipotential surface serves as a reference surface, for instance, in oceanography (for dynamic ocean topography) and in geodesy (for height systems and a globally unified height datum).For the very first time it will now be possible to study the gravity field in Antarctica on a continental scale and in a homogeneous and consistent way. This is facilitated by the recent availability of a new Antarctic-wide compilation of ground-based gravity data published by an international consortium with one of the applicants being lead author (Scheinert et al., 2016). Thus, we aim to unite the expertise of both applicants in global gravity field modelling based on modern satellite gravity missions such as GRACE and GOCE on the one hand, and in regional gravity field improvement in Antarctica based on terrestrial and near-surface gravity measurements on the other hand. Hence, the main objective of our proposal is to determine a combined, consistent, high-resolution gravity field model of Antarctica. This will be based on a thorough validation and homogenization of the Antarctic terrestrial gravity data and their combination with satellite data. We will develop innovative methods for an optimal combination of all gravity data investigating regional and regionally tailored global approaches taking different properties like accuracy and spectral resolution into account. Using this improved continental-wide gravity field model a further objective is to investigate the lithospheric inversion including density and geometry (subglacial topography, Moho depths). For this, we will make use of additional data like ice thickness measurements from radio echo sounding (RES) and grounding line locations. The inversion of the gravity data will utilize sophisticated methods with different ways of constraining by those additional data. Thus, we aim to contribute to overcoming the deficiencies of our knowledge of subglacial topography and lithospheric structure in Antarctica. Both the methods for combined gravity field modelling and gravity inversion with constraints have to be further developed and adapted to the specific situation in Antarctica.The gravity field model as well as the lithospheric model will be complemented by realistic uncertainty estimates. Finally, the impact of these models on several geoscientific disciplines will be assessed, and their usability will be outlined in a scientific roadmap. ']"
